#,CreditRatingDowngraded,Credit rating downgraded!,"The major international credit agencies have downgraded the status of your governments debt. This is likely to have a knock-on effect on GDP as foreign companies become wary of investing in our economy, and it will also result in the interest rate we pay on our debt rising. there is a good chance this will upset our capitalist voters too.

The assassin has confirmed intelligence service suspicions that he was hired by a top secret group of hyper-rich industrialists known as 'The Battenburg Group'. It seems there are a number of extremist capitalists who want you dead, and your government out of office. Be careful."
#,FailedConservativeAssassination,Failed Assassination Attempt!,It looks like the extremist wing of the conservative 'Traditional Values Alliance' have taken it upon themselves to eliminate you as head of the government.

A group of armed anti-government protesters, claiming to be from the 'Black Power Group' opened fire on government buildings this morning, breaking windows and injuring some staff, but luckily causing no fatalities. The group accused the government of racism, and said they represented the anger of this country's ethnic minorities. We should be wary of the potential for future such attacks."
#,FailedFarmersAssassination,Failed Assassination Attempt!,"At 10.21AM today our security people arrested a man trying to get his way into a press briefing with a loaded shotgun. Apparently he was from 'The Farmers Alliance', an extremist group formed to fight government policies on agriculture. Security forces have been watching this organization for some time, and it's clear that as long as government policies do not change, we are going to have to expect more attacks like this. This time, we got lucky."
#,FailedGreenAssassination,Assassination Attempt!,"There has been a failed attempt on your life by a Green Terrorist group known as 'The Green Brigade'. You were lucky that brave members of your intelligence forces managed to intercept them in time. In the future we may not be so lucky, so you might want to review security measures.

We might not be so lucky next time."

Apparently, some sort of ultra-patriotic paramilitary organization, they have recently become more and more aggressive in their criticisms of the government. Today, we managed to catch them before they got any closer. We may not be so lucky next time."
#,FailedReligiousAssassination,Failed Assassination Attempt!,"Secret service earned their pay today, when they arrested a carload of what appear to be religious fanatics planning an attack on you and the cabinet. A van, filled with explosives, and small arms was stopped by our vigilant police, after intelligence intercepted by our security personnel. It seems there are a number of religious extremists determined to remove the current government. This lot called themselves 'The Army of God'."
#,FailedSocialistAssassination,Failed Assassination Attempt!,"Earlier today, our excellent secret service personnel arrested five armed men converging on government headquarters apparently with a plan to assassinate you.

#,GainNewDonor,New Major Party Donor!,"Your fundraising efforts have managed to attract a new wealthy individual to donate to your future campaign fund. Make sure you keep this donor happy, and pay attention to the groups they sympathize with. If donors become unhappy there is a chance you will lose their vital financial support."
#,LoseDonor,Major Donor Abandons party!,It looks like you have not been keeping an eye on the opinions of our major financial backers. One of our wealthy donors has just cut their support for our party. This may have an effect on our ability to campaign effectively unless we can find a replacement donor (and keep them...)
#,_MinisterialResignation,Ministerial Resignation,One of your ministers has had enough of serving in your government and has stepped down to 'spend more time with their family'. You will have to find someone suitable to replace them as soon as possible.
#,socialmediascandal,Social Media Scandal,"An investigation has revealed a shocking abuse of privacy by leading tech companies behind popular social media sites. A lack of decent privacy protections and law enforcement has meant tech companies have freely harvested vast amounts of private information which has then been sold on to the highest bidder. This is a perfect example of one of the dangers of our always-connected lifestyles. Naturally, privacy campaigners are outraged that you let this happen."
#,tsunami,Tsunami!,"A devastating tsunami has hit our coastline. Although we prepare for such events, its impossible to prevent all loss of life and damage. The destruction to our coastal towns and fishing industry is severe and will be a significant blow to our economy."

Argentinian soldiers landed and planted a flag, and after a brief speech for TV, then withdrew, but this is a worrying sign that the Argentinian government feels we may be unable to defend the islands a second time if they attempt another invasion."
#,russianships,Russian ships approach,"In an increasingly blatant attempt to intimidate us and test our defenses, Russian navy ships and planes have approached extremely close to our borders, requiring us to scramble defenses. This shows that our military capabilities are not considered much of a deterrent at present."
#,heatwave,Heat Wave,"As global temperatures have risen, our weather has become more extreme, and we are currently in the middle of a dangerous spell of hot weather, leading to wildfires and multiple deaths.
