#,GlobalCO2,Globala CO2-utsläpp,"Mängd kol Vi sätter i atmosfären. Miljöaktivister och majoriteten av forskare är överens om att begränsa våra CO2-utsläpp är ett viktigt steg vi bör ta för att bekämpa klimatförändringen. Att inte kontrollera våra utsläpp kan sänka vår internationella ställning och påverka utrikesförbindelserna. En blomstrande ekonomi, om den inte kontrolleras, kommer att producera mer kol, liksom höga nivåer av bil-och flygresor. Det finns ett stort antal olika strategier som kan användas för att minimera nivån av CO2-utsläpp."
#,Health,Health,A general indicator for the health of your citizens that measures fitness and the general wellbeing of people.
#,Education,Education,"A measurement of the education level of the average citizen. Not only literacy, but numeracy and general understanding of everything from history to IT and science."
#,CrimeRate,Crime,"An indicator of the level of general non violent crime in your nation. This includes crimes such as car crime, burglary etc., but also covers fraud and other similar crimes."
#,ViolentCrimeRate,Violent Crime,"A more worrying indicator than the overall crime level, this measures the frequency of violent crimes such as murder, rape and muggings. Violent crime is a worry for everyone in the country."
#,PovertyRate,Poverty,"One of the most widely used measures of comparison between nations. The poverty level is periodically reassessed, but all nations should strive to get their poverty rate as low as possible."
#,Equality,Equality,"There are many ways to measure equality. Conservatives talk of equality of opportunity, socialists talk of equality of outcome. This is just a simple measurement of the distribution of wealth (financial equality of outcome)."
#,Environment,The Environment,"A general measurement of the quality of the environment, including air quality, but also measuring noise pollution, litter, water quality and many other measures of pollution."
#,WorkingWeek,Working Week,"The number of hours worked on average by your citizens in a week. In a fluctuating economy, this may vary from the contracted hours as people give into pressure to work unpaid or paid overtime to keep their jobs. To employees, shorter hours are seen as a good thing."
#,Technology,Technology,"A general index of the level of technological sophistication of the country, including the percentage of citizens with internet access, and high speed broadband, as well as the technological understanding of students, and the capabilities of industry. A high technological index boosts international competitiveness. Tax incentives may be required to attract high tech industry."
#,CarUsage,Car Usage,"A measure of how many miles per year the average household travels by car. High car usage can cause pollution, but is inevitable in a booming economy with poor provision of public transport."
#,RailUsage,Rail Usage,"A measure of the amount of journeys that take place by rail. Supporters of public transport will look for high rail usage, in order to reduce both traffic congestion and also pollution. Rail travel can be very efficient in highly populated countries, but improvements to rail  infrastructure can be extremely expensive and take a long time."
#,BusUsage,Bus Usage,"A measure of the amount of journeys that are taken by bus, as opposed to car, air or rail. Buses are more environmentally friendly than cars, so are seen as a way to reduce pollution, as well as reduce traffic congestion."
#,WorkerProductivity,Productivity,"The average output in financial terms of a typical citizen. Some nations have more productive employees than others, due to such factors as work ethic, technical knowledge and workplace hours."
#,Unemployment,Unemployment,At its simplest this is a count of the percentage of your population who aren't in gainful employment. Adjusted to omit those citizens who are not actively seeking work for one reason or another.
#,CO2Emissions,CO2 Emissions,"Amount of carbon we put into the atmosphere. Environmentalists and the majority of scientists agree that limiting our CO2 Emissions is a vital step we should take to fight climate change. Failing to control our emissions can lower our international standing and affect foreign relations. A booming economy, if unchecked, will produce more carbon, as will high levels of car and air travel. There are a vast range of different strategies that can be employed to minimize the level of CO2 emissions."
#,AirTravel,Air Travel,"Air travel is often strongly linked to a country's economy, and thus GDP. Wealthier citizens take more foreign holidays, and a richer economy will mean more business air travel, and more products shipped by air freight. The amount of air travel is very price sensitive, so changes in fuel costs, taxes and other charges can have a major effect."
#,Immigration,Immigration,"Immigration measures the number of people actually entering this country legally with the intent of making this their new home. Immigration is generally caused by a strong economy, as those living in poorer countries seek out employment and a higher standard of living. Immigration can be reduced by regulation, but this may drive illegal immigration. Too much immigration too fast can lead to racial tensions developing."
#,ImmigrationDemand,Immigration Demand,"Immigration measures the number of people wishing to enter this country, both legally and illegally, with the intent of making this their new home."
#,EnergyEfficiency,Energy Efficiency,"This is a general measure of how efficiently the country uses its energy resources. Low car energy standards, and a lack of investment in new technology will mean a wasteful economy, and in turn, higher demand for fossil fuels such as oil. Reducing energy usage has become more urgent in recent times due to concerns about climate change, and the drive to reduce CO2 emissions."
#,RacialTension,Racial Tension,"The degree to which there is unease between different nationalities and cultures. Sudden, uncontrolled immigration can sometimes lead to racial tensions, which can in the worst case, result in violent clashes."
#,ForeignRelations,Foreign Relations,"Foreign relations are important for two reasons, firstly as a way of preventing disputes escalating into wars or terrorism which may threaten our citizens, and secondly, as a way to ensure trade relations are good and that we benefit economically from trade and tourism with other nations."
#,InternationalTrade,International Trade,"International trade is generally good for an economy, due to the law of comparative advantage, effectively helping each country to produce what it is best at. Trade can be restricted by political problems with other countries, where arguments can lead to import tariffs and sanctions. In some cases, countries also indulge in 'protectionism' to defend politically sensitive industries against foreign competition."
#,OilDemand,Oil Demand,"Our demand for oil comes from industry, road travel and air travel. The more our citizens fly and drive, the greater our demand for oil, although energy efficiency measures and hybrid cars can reduce this somewhat, as can investments in cleaner industry and renewable energy sources."
#,OilSupply,Oil Supply,"Our oil supplies can only really be expanded by opening up new parts of our territory for drilling, which can be politically and ecologically difficult. Together with the oil demand, the supply sets the price, which has a strong effect on our economy."
#,OilPrice,Oil Price,"The oil price affects the economy, with higher prices lowering our general standard of living, although this will be mitigated by energy efficiency measures. A lower level of oil dependence will also make us less sensitive to global oil price shocks caused by political instabilities."
#,_Terrorism,Terrorism,hidden
#,_LowIncome,Poor Earnings,"The effective income of those people who are on low (or no) earnings in our society. If this value rises high enough (through benefits and tax exemptions for the poor), then more people will move out of poverty and in to the middle income group. Progressive taxation, combined with well-funded public services and state benefits are the most popular ways to 'lift people' out of poverty."
#,_MiddleIncome,Middle Earnings,"The effective income of those people on average earnings, not wealthy or poor. This is generally the largest group of people in the economy, so policies which affect this value can be big vote deciders. Middle income earners are expected to own their own homes (or be buying them), and often own one or more cars. They probably take holidays abroad at least once a year. Taxes that affect any of these will hit these people hardest, and may push some of them down into poverty"
#,_HighIncome,High Earnings,"The effective income of the top earners in society. It is easy to reduce this by punitive taxes on the wealthy, their property, inheritance and activities such as air travel that they often indulge in. It is also possible to benefit them by offering tax exemptions and loopholes for the rich, or by favoring regressive taxation such as sales tax, rather than progressive income taxes."
#,GDP,GDP,"The Gross Domestic product of your country. This is defined as The total market value of all the goods and services produced within the nation in a year. This is a good general-purpose measure of the strength of your economy, and the nations overall wealth. One of the contributing factors is the global economic cycle, which tends to be cyclical, and is beyond your control."
#,PrivateHealthcare,Private Health Care,"The size of the private healthcare sector. This will arise naturally from supply and demand, and be boosted in boom times, but can be reduced by providing a decent state health care system instead. The downside with private health care is that the poorest in society can not afford it, and may also avoid treatment until it becomes essential in order to save costs."
#,PrivateHousing,Private Housing,"The size of the private housing sector. Private housing will respond naturally to supply and demand, but can be artificially deflated by the supply of subsidized state housing, or rent controls on the private sector."
#,PrivateSchools,Private Schools,"The size of the private education sector. This will contract if the state provides a high quality system of state education. In tough economic times, there will be many in society who cannot afford private education."
#,PrivatePensions,Private Pensions,"The size of the private pension sector. This may run alongside a minimal state pension, or completely replace it in countries that are happy to leave retirement planning to individuals. Many poor members of society will not have the means to save adequately for their retirement without state help."
#,TobaccoUse,Tobacco Usage,"The popularity of smoking in your population. Smoking obviously reduces the health levels of your population, and may therefore affect their productivity. Plus, smoking will place extra burdens on the cost of healthcare."
#,AlcoholConsumption,Alcohol Consumption,"The level of alcohol consumption in your country.  A high level of consumption will mean the state earns a considerable sum from any alcohol taxes, but it can also lead to increased crime, antisocial behavior and a drop in both health levels and productivity."
#,TrafficCongestion,Traffic Congestion,"The level of traffic congestion on your roads. This is chiefly driven by private cars, so reducing car usage will prevent this becoming a problem. Travel by bus or train is far more efficient and will help reduce congestion, even in boom times."
#,Tourism,Tourism,"The size of the tourism industry. Tourists will prefer to visit countries with no major social problems, and also prefer low sales taxes. A decent reputation for your country overseas will also boost tourism. Generally, tourism is seen as positive as it brings money into the economy. Encouraging tourism may partially depend on low air travel costs, which can have implications for pollution and CO2 emissions."
#,Wages,Wages,"The average wage level in your country. Wages are generally set by supply and demand, which roughly equates to the labor supply and the state of the economy (GDP). Immigration raises the labor supply, reducing wages, and high unemployment will also put downward pressure on wages. Labor laws, including minimum wages can push wages artificially higher, although this will have side-effects."
#,LegalDrugConsumption,Legal Drug Consumption,"The amount of legal narcotics such as Cannabis, Heroin and Ecstasy that are consumed in the country. Obviously if these drugs are not legal, this value will be zero. As these drugs are a commodity available on the free market, their consumption will be affected by the GDP of the country as well as the extent to which they are legal. Some governments may wish to use consumption of them as a target for taxation."
#,CurrencyStrength,Currency Strength,"The relative strength of your currency on the global markets. A strong economy will raise this value, which will make exports less competitive, and reduce export income, as well as reducing the spending power of tourists, and vice versa."
#,FoodPrice,Food Price,The average food price is determined by domestic food production and imports. Growing world population and increasingly resource intensive food production contribute to a higher food price and might ultimately lead to a food price crisis.
#,AverageTemperature,Average Temperature,The worldwide average temperature is rising. Capping CO2 emmissions and participating in international treaties can slow down the development but not put a stop to it. Higher average temperatures lead to natural disasters and increasing worldwide competition for water and other natural resources.
#,Lifespan,Lifespan,"The expected lifespan of an individual. This can be boosted by technological advances and reduced by pollution, disease and other phenomena."
#,InternetCurrencyAdoption,Cryptocurrency Adoption,The adoption rate of cryptocurrencies that are traded over the internet.
#,IndustrialAutomation,Industrial Automation,"This value describes the general state of automation of your industry. The bigger the robot workforce, the higher the value. Automation reduces the working week and increases productivity but at the cost of making many low-skilled workers unemployed."
#,HealthcareDemand,Healthcare Demand,"The frequency with which the average citizen will make demands on the healthcare industry or service. This will be lower with a generally healthier population, but conversely will be higher given better technology enabling more complex and advanced treatment."
#,InternetSpeed,Internet Speed,"The general state of IT infrastructure in the country, which on a personal level translates to the availability and average speed of internet access through both land-based and wireless/mobile technology"
#,Veganism,Plant Based Diets,"The proportion of the population who are vegan or vegetarian, as well as those who consider themselves 'flexitarians' deliberately eating less meat, or having meat-free days each week"
#,GenerationalWealthGap,Generational Wealth Gap,"The extent to which older people are wealthier than younger, which can cause social division, and is often related to property prices."
#,ElectricCarTransition,Electric Car Transition,"The progress in converting society from using fossil fuel powered vehicles towards using electric vehicles, which are less damaging to the environment"
#,PrivateTelecoms,Telecoms Industry,"In most countries the telecoms industry is privately owned with competing companies, but the state may wish to nationalise or control this industry to ensure provision for all."
#,PrivateWater,Water Industry,"The water industry can be run as a series of private companies, but it is a natural monopoly and often regulated, or even nationalised."
#,PrivateRail,Rail Industry,"Private rail companies claim to be more efficient, but are a natural monopoly and are sometimes nationalised to allow the state to subsidize public transport."
#,PrivateEnergy,Energy Industry,"Although many countries have competing electricity and gas/oil companies, it can be argued that the energy market is a natural monopoly."
#,BusinessConfidence,Business Confidence,"Above everything, businesses like stability and the rule of law. Any uncertainty will reduce business confidence, and investment and thus  eventually impact GDP."
#,Population,Population,How many people there are in this great country of ours. A high population can lead to economic issues relating to the price of land and the availability of natural resources.
#,Inflation,Inflation,"A measure of the rate at which prices and wages rise each year. Generally speaking inflation should be low but not 'too low'. Low inflation runs the risk of deflation, which can paralyze the economy, whereas inflation being too high risks hyperinflation and economic collapse."
#,Charity,Charity,"Donations from members of the public and corporations to any charitable causes. People can only donate what they can afford, and their tendency to donate may be influenced by whether or not they see gaps in state provision for good causes."
,,,
#,HumanDevelopment,Human Development,"The average level of human development in your country. This metric has three dimensions across your entire population: their health, their level of education, and their income. A high level of human development will attract immigration and cultural tourism, and is an indicator for the development of your country overall."
#,Corruption,Corruption,"Any form of dishonest or unethical behaviour by those in positions of authority, both in the public and private sectors. Corruption creates a drag on your economy, as resources are stolen or squandered inefficiently, and it curtails foreign interest in aid and investment. Voters become increasingly untrusting of their nation's administration as corruption rises."
#,ForeignAidReceived,Foreign Aid Received,"The amount of foreign aid received. Resources may be transferred from one country to another for a number of reasons. If your country is poor, and has acute issues that can be alleviated by aid, it may be given for humanitarian and altruistic purposes. Foreign aid may also be given as a sign of diplomatic approval, to strengthen an alliance, or to gain commercial access to your country's resources."
#,Democracy,Democracy,"The state of democracy in your country. This measure reflects the level of implementation of democratic systems  that encourage electoral pluralism, political participation, civil liberties, and the functioning of government. As leader, curtailing democracy is a method of gaining personal power and controlling your country's citizens, but may be met with wide disapproval."
#,GenderEquality,Gender Equality,"A measure of equality between female and male citizens. Socially constructed gender roles can result in the unequal treatment and perception of individuals based on their gender. Dimensions of gender inequality are measured in female reproductive health, empowerment, and labor market participation."
#,Stability,Stability,"The stability of the state. This is a measure of how stable the incumbent regime is in your nation, taking into account a broad range of indicators to assess the risk of collapse. Instability will have an impact on foreign relations, investment and tourism, and indicates that there are fundamental issues with your country's governance."
#,ForeignInvestment,Foreign Investment,"The amount of investment in domestic enterprises and infrastructure by foreign investors. Investors may identify your country as a good place to invest if it is considered stable, and offers benefits over competing territories, such as a productive and cheap labor force. "
#,Emigration,Emigration,"A measure of the number of people who decide to leave this country permanently and take up residence elsewhere, which can be for economic reasons, or concerns about the country's stability or safety."
#,IllegalImmigration,Illegal Immigration,A measure of the number of people who are managing to enter our country despite not having the correct documentation. This can be reduced by stronger border controls and similar measures. Many of the same forces driving immigration also drive illegal immigration.
#,RareEarthPrice,Rare Earth Metal Prices,"The current free market price for a host of special metals used in high tech equipment such as smartphones, electric cars, wind turbines and computer equipment. A good supply of such metals is necessary for a high tech economy."
#,MentalHealth,Mental Health,"A measure of the current state of our citizens mental health. Mental Health issues can place a huge burden on healthcare providers, and reduce the general happiness of our citizens, so it should be a major priority for every government. A reasonable work/life balance can help, extreme problems such as extreme high crime, drug addictions and poverty will worsen mental health, as will a poor environment."

#,youthcrime, Ungdomsbrott,"Ungdomsbrott representerar alla brott begångna av personer under 18 år",
#,StrayAnimals,"Hemmafria Djur","Hemmafria djur, oavsett om det är hundar, katter, apor eller liknande djur, är djur utan hem eller djur som strejkar på gatorna.",
#,OrphansAndHomelessMinors,"Fosterbarn och Hemlösa Minderåriga", "Fosterbarn och hemlösa minderåriga är personer mellan 0-17 år som inte kan ta hand om sig själva eller skydda sig själva.",

#,MilitaryPower1, "Militär styrka", "En stark militär styrka är en viktig del av att utöva vårt inflytande runt om i världen och hålla vårt land säkert. Det finns många sätt att öka vår militära makt och räckvidd, vilket resulterar i en starkare och mer varierad stridskraft."
#,GlobalInfluence1, "Globalt inflytande", "Alla länder har inte lika mycket vikt när det gäller att påverka politiken runt om i världen. De som är ekonomiskt viktiga, har en kraftfull militär eller är teknologiskt avancerade har alla en fördel när det gäller globala angelägenheter. När vi ökar vårt globala inflytande, kommer vi att få mer inflytande med andra länder i världen."
#,ForeignThreat1, "Internationell hotbedömning", "Även om fullskalig krigföring mellan globala makter har varit mycket mindre förekommande under 2000-talet, har interstatliga konflikter fortsatt på ett mer dämpat sätt. Spionage, valpåverkan och cyberkrigföring är alla knep som används mot rivaler. Vi kan minska detta genom allianser, militärutplacering och hämndåtgärder. Vi kommer aldrig att veta exakt vad våra fiender har för planer, så de värden vi har är uppskattningar som vi tror ligger nära sanningen."
#,ActualThreat1, "OKÄNT", "dolt"
#,GlobalStability1, "Global stabilitet", "Förutom ett lands individuella stabilitet måste nationer också vara oroade över den globala stabiliteten. Krig, katastrofala katastrofer och klimatförändringar kan alla destabilisera många länder samtidigt. Vid höga nivåer av kaos är terrorism och konflikter vanliga. Genom att bilda allianser med andra nationer och upprätthålla ordning globalt med vår militär kan vi bidra till att öka stabiliteten."
