#,Adoption,Enstaka adoptioner,"Singlar har för närvarande svårt att adoptera ett barn i vårt land. Tidigare var det svårt för ensamstående föräldrar, men nuförtiden har det varit lättare för dem att kombinera att ha ett barn och en karriär samtidigt. Så för dem som vill ha ett barn men inte kan hitta eller inte vill ha en partner, adoption bör underlättas."
#,Adoption_0,Ändra kraven,"Singlar förtjänar samma rättigheter som par att adoptera ett barn. Lätta på kraven för ensamstående adoptioner, med daghem och flexibla arbetstider, singel borde ha chansen att uppfostra och älska ett barn också."
#,Adoption_1,Håll kraven,"Adopterade barn behöver ett stabilt hem och två föräldrar. Medan vissa ensamstående föräldrar lyckas uppfostra ett barn på egen hand, befinner de sig ofta i trubbel, vilket skulle orsaka ännu mer skada för det adopterade barnet."
#,AgeBasedDrivingTests,Age-Based Driving Tests,There is a proposal to introduce regular refresher driving tests for the elderly to ensure they are still safe drivers. This is considered to be a safety matter to reduce road traffic accidents.
#,AgeBasedDrivingTests_0,Introduce tests,"It's a fact of life that peoples eyesight deteriorates over time, their reaction times get longer, and many elderly drivers can simply be a danger to other road users, especially small children. The older drivers may resist it, but for everyone's safety this needs to be done. Those people who are still safe drivers have nothing to fear."
#,AgeBasedDrivingTests_1,Keep single test,"Frankly, older drivers are the least of our problems when it comes to traffic accidents. Older drivers are less likely to be irresponsible with drink or drugs and driving, and have vastly more experience. Its an insult to the elderly to force them to prove they can still drive. We already have police and cameras to detect people driving irresponsibly."
#,Airport,Airport connection,"A new airport is planned for the capital, far off the city centre. What should be used as the main connection of the airport and the city centre?"
#,Airport_0,Cars,"Public transport is all well and good, but we know people generally prefer to drive. Lets build a new road connecting the airport to the city center. People who don't drive can always hire a taxi to get to the airport."
#,Airport_1,Busses,"The airport itself is already a major cause for pollution and the noise is just as bad. Let's not make it worse and go with a well planned bus system, This will be efficient, low pollution and low congestion."
#,AirportExpansion,Airport Expansion,Planning permission has been requested for the expansion of some of our country's largest airports. There is simply not enough capacity for the number of flights that want to land here.
#,AirportExpansion_0,Allow Expansion Plans,"Our tourism industry is very dependent on air travel, and if we are to expand tourism, providing more jobs and growth in GDP, we must make more air capacity available. We need to act now to ensure we have the increased capacity in time."
#,AirportExpansion_1,Reject Plans,"Air travel is a pollution nightmare, both air and noise pollution cause problems, we should not be encouraging air travel. Also, the plans would mean the demolition of countless homes and vast inconvenience to people living near the airports. Reject the plans!"
#,AirportExpansion_2,Delay Decision,"This is a tough decision, but frankly not one we MUST take this year. it may seem a bit indecisive but we can just put this off for a while. Maybe even until after the next election?"
#,AllowForeignFightersToReturn,Allow Foreign Fighters To Return,"Some of our religious citizens left our country to fight in a religious war overseas, a war that in many ways threatened our interests and security. That fighting has now ended, and the fighters have expressed regret for their actions and a desire to return home."
#,AllowForeignFightersToReturn_0,Block fighters from returning,"When our citizens leave this country to go fight alongside our enemies abroad, they lose any claim to citizenship and any right to live here. Under no circumstances should they be allowed back, not even to stand trial. It would be an insult to our soldiers and security services."
#,AllowForeignFightersToReturn_1,Allow fighters to return,"Its a difficult principle to defend, but we have to accept that our citizens are our citizens, even when they commit crimes abroad, or in this case even take up arms against us. By all means prosecute them for their actions, but we cannot deny their citizenship because we find it inconvenient."
#,AppointAmbassador,Appoint UN Ambassador,Our ambassador to the UN retires this year and we need to name a successor as soon as possible. Much will be made of whether we appoint a hardliner who sticks up for the country or someone more able to compromise.
#,AppointAmbassador_0,Appoint Tonya Robinson,"Tonya Robinson is well known as a patriot who will fight tooth and claw to get our interests represented at the UN. Seen as a popular choice amongst patriotic and more conservative citizens, she is historically against foreign aid and a supporter of import tariffs. She is not popular internationally."
#,AppointAmbassador_1,Appoint Dennis Gonzales,"Dennis Gonzales is a popular figure on the international stage with a reputation for solving difficult problems through compromise and understanding. A true internationalist, he is popular with the liberals and socialists in our society, as well as foreign leaders."
#,AppointJudge,Appoint Senior Judge,"One of our most senior and respected judges has died, and we now need to make a choice for his replacement amongst the nominated candidates. This individual will sit in our courts for a very long time so we must make the right decision."
#,AppointJudge_0,Appoint Edgar Lopez,"Edgar Lopez has been a strong supporter of human rights, making many landmark rulings in favor of individuals rights and liberties. He is also seen as being strongly pro-consumer, and not afraid to challenge large corporations."
#,AppointJudge_1,Appoint Alice Reed,"Alice Reed is a household name thanks to her many famous rulings concerning violent crimes and her often outspoken views on the harsh sentences that she feels should be applied to thieves, muggers and shoplifters."
#,AttendGayWedding,Attend Gay Wedding,"A super-popular celebrity is getting married, and you are invited as one of the guests. This would normally not be in any way controversial, but this is a same-sex couple, and the celebrity is a well known advocate for LGBT rights. Will you attend?"
#,AttendGayWedding_0,Attend the wedding,"Of course you should attend, and do so proudly, and give thanks for the invitation. Its the 21st century and people who would think less of a politician because of the sexual orientation of the people whose weddings he attends really need to move with the times. Its embarrassing that this should even be an issue."
#,AttendGayWedding_1,Do not attend,"Its clearly not compulsory for a political leader to show up at every celebrity wedding, regardless how well they may know the bride or groom. Running the country is a full-time job, and if you happen to have some important matters of state to attend to on that day, then everyone will understand that you cannot attend."
#,AttendLGBTPlay,Attend LGBT Play,"A very well-received and popular play is currently on at our country's finest theater. The director has invited you to attend a performance. This would not be an issue, but the play is a commentary on society's attitudes to those in the LGBT community. Attending the play will be seen to show strong sympathy to the LGBT movement."
#,AttendLGBTPlay_0,Attend the play,"This is a political easy win, as attending the play does not cost anything, or involve any legislation whatsoever, but allows you to show some interest in, and sympathy with the LGBT community. It would be tasteless to turn down the invitation."
#,AttendLGBTPlay_1,Decline invitation,"You do not have to accept every invitation that comes your way. The director is obviously cynically trying to use the invitation to force a show of support for his agenda, which is unseemly and cynical. Not attending the play is a perfectly reasonable response."
#,BAILOUTCOMPANY,Bail Out Company,"Stargazy Steelworks Inc, one of the largest steelworks in the country has run into serious financial difficulties and is on the verge of going under. The company executives think they can get new orders in and keep the company going if the government will provide an interest free loan to keep them running for the next few months."
#,BAILOUTCOMPANY_0,Help The Company,This company employs thousands of people and there are a lot of other companies that provide services for them who will also be affected if the company goes under. Just think of the effect it will have on the local economy if we let this company close down. We should provide a tax-free loan.
#,BAILOUTCOMPANY_1,Do Nothing,"This is called the free market. The Company is going under because it is not profitable. If it was sensible to lend them money the private sector would be doing so. This is just throwing good money after bad. Sure there will be short term unemployment, but you can't fight the free market."
#,BAILOUTCOMPANY_2,Take Partial Ownership,"Obviously we do not want this company to fail, but handing taxpayers cash to a private enterprise with nothing in return is foolhardy. Lets bail them out, but seize a minority stake in the business as a condition."
#,BakingGayCakes,Baking Gay Cakes,"A bakers owned by a religious couple has been taken to court for discrimination, after they refused to bake a celebration cake for a same-sex couple, on religious grounds, given their churches disapproval of homosexuality. The law clearly needs clarifying in cases like these."
#,BakingGayCakes_0,Support the bakers,"Surely its a basic principle of running a business that you can turn away custom that you do not want? Are we really going to force people to produce work that they find  blasphemous so as not to offend a customer? This is clear provocation, as there are plenty of other bakers who would happily have baked the cake."
#,BakingGayCakes_1,Support the same-sex couple,"Discrimination is discrimination, regardless of ones religion. Its a very slippery slope if we allow people to claim that they can turn customers away for religious reasons, even if this conflicts with the law. They are free to disapprove of the lifestyle of the couple, but they cannot legitimately refuse to do business with them."
#,BAN ALCOHOL ADVERTS,Ban Alcohol Adverts,"There is a proposal for a law to outlaw the advertising of alcohol on television. Although it would remain legal to advertise on radio, billboards and other means, a TV ban is seen as a potential way to reduce alcohol intake by our citizens."
#,BAN ALCOHOL ADVERTS_0,Reject Ban,This law is crazy. Either you have a ban on a product or you do not. Alcohol is perfectly legal and enjoyed by millions of citizens without ill effect. Banning advertising of a product on a particular medium is a token gesture for the anti-alcohol zealots which does nothing but interfere in the free market.
#,BAN ALCOHOL ADVERTS_1,Approve Ban,"It might not stop alcoholism overnight, but a TV ad ban is a step in the right direction. Advertisers have been increasingly aggressive in their advertising, with a worrying tendency towards marketing their products at the youth market. Anything we can do to reduce alcohol consumption is worth trying."
#,BanAnimalTesting,Ban Animal Testing,"A proposal to ban all animal experimentation has been placed before government by pressure groups. We currently have quite a few people working in industries that use animal testing, but it is also a highly unpopular practice."
#,BanAnimalTesting_0,Ban it,"In this day and age there is no good reason to test any products on animals, especially cosmetics. The practices used are often incredibly cruel, and a ban would have widespread public support and little real impact on industry."
#,BanAnimalTesting_1,No change,"Products are only tested on animals in order to ensure there is no chance of danger to humans, and it's only done as a last resort under controlled conditions. If we impose such a drastic ban it will hit our cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries badly."
#,BanEScooters,Ban E-Scooters,"Technological advances and a glut of venture capital have combined to make running an electric-scooter rental company the new gold-rush. As a result, competing companies have distributed tens of thousands of these bikes all over our city centers. Residents are angry at the mess, as they are often abandoned randomly in the streets. There are calls for a ban on these businesses."
#,BanEScooters_0,Ban E-Scooter rentals,This is a typical example of arrogant private businesses treating the public streets as their own storage and storefront without even so much as a public consultation. Abandoned bikes clutter our streets annoying pedestrians and motorists alike. A ban is the only reasonable response.
#,BanEScooters_1,Do Nothing,"This is capitalism working as intended and will soon work itself out. To immediately ban such businesses is a Luddite move, and anti-business. For all we know this is the start of a golden age of convenient transportation. If people don't want to rent them, the companies will soon go bust."
#,BanFaceRecognitionInPublic,Ban Face Recognition In Public,"Advances in AI have resulted in it being cheap and practical to recognize faces using simple cameras in our streets. In theory this is great for detecting criminals, but opens up the whole topic of privacy and big data. Should we step in to prevent the blanketing of our cities with face-recognition cameras that store who-knows what information?"
#,BanFaceRecognitionInPublic_0,Ban face recognition,"This technology is amazing but terrifying. We have no idea what private companies, or future governments will do with the information that is being collected by these cameras. This is the ultimate surveillance state, used either for oppression or profit, and we should stop it immediately."
#,BanFaceRecognitionInPublic_1,Allow face recognition,"Nobody is worried that a passer by can see their face, so why the outrage about a camera? unless you are a wanted criminal or terrorist what exactly is the problem? the collection of this data helps both to fight crime, and provide us with amazing personalized services. It would be a technophobic over-reaction to ban its usage."
#,BanForeignFirmFromITInfrastructure,Ban Foreign Firm From IT Infrastructure,Upgrades to our telecoms infrastructure would involve buying hardware from a prominent foreign company with strong links to a foreign government with dubious motives. Security professionals have expressed serious concern that this will undermine our security and are calling for the company to be blacklisted.
#,BanForeignFirmFromITInfrastructure_0,Ban foreign firm,"With society increasingly dependent on Internet and telecoms, is it really sensible to allow dubious foreign powers to effectively control our infrastructure? Modern IT system are so complex we can never really know what they have introduced, and in the event of a conflict with this nation, it will be too late to regret what we have done."
#,BanForeignFirmFromITInfrastructure_1,Allow usage of foreign firm,"This is government interference that borders on the xenophobic. Of course it would be wonderful if all of our critical security equipment could be manufactured at home at bargain prices, but in the real world we have to buy overseas. Banning this company would simply make all our infrastructure much more expensive for no noticeable gain."
#,Banknotes,Face on the new bank notes,New bank notes will be introduced soon and a new face has to be put on them. An honorable archbishop and a famous human rights activist from our country have made it to the final list and it is now for you to decide who will be the face of our currency in the future.
#,Banknotes_0,Choose archbishop Fernando Martinez,"The archbishop Fernando Martinez was truly a holy man, very dependable and pure. His strong belief may have been a bit much for liberals, but he serves as a role model for conservatives. Putting his face on our bank will certainly send out a subtle message of our countries faith."
#,Banknotes_1,Choose Natalie Garcia,"Natalie Garcia has always been on the frontline to defend human rights from anyone, anywhere in the world. This has brought her trouble with many major corporations, but the people love and support her. With her face on our bank notes we will send a message of freedom and liberty to the whole world."
#,BanLivestockImports,Ban livestock Imports,"One of our neighboring countries has had a publicly announced case of 'foot and mouth' disease in its cattle. Although the chances of the disease being spread to us is very low, you are being lobbied by farmers groups to ban the import of cattle from that country as a precaution."
#,BanLivestockImports_0,Reject Ban,"There is no statistical or scientific basis for a blanket ban on livestock imports from that country. The outbreak is highly contained and poses little real risk. This will be an unpopular move overseas, which will be seen as blatant protectionism. This would be an unfair and unjustified embargo of foreign goods."
#,BanLivestockImports_1,Approve Ban,"It's just not worth the risk, however slight it may be, of us importing this disease to our country. The only way to deal with it is the mass slaughter of cattle, and our agricultural industry would not survive that. This may seem over cautious, but better to be safe than sorry. If the situation was reversed, they would do the same to us."
#,BanNonLEDBulbs,Ban Non LED Bulbs,"LED light bulbs are incredibly efficient, more so than compact fluorescent, and dramatically more than incandescent bulbs. There are calls to ban the sale of older bulbs to encourage everyone to switch to LEDs in order to reduce energy usage and help fight climate change."
#,BanNonLEDBulbs_0,Ban non-LED light bulbs,"Most people simply are not aware of how far LED bulbs have come, or how much energy they can save over their lifetime. They have been available for years, but uptake is too slow. A ban on older-tech bulbs is the fastest way to get people to adopt the new technology, which will be an easy way to make progress on reducing CO2 emissions."
#,BanNonLEDBulbs_1,Refuse the ban,"Its really not that long ago that compact fluorescent bulbs were the new thing, and suddenly there is pressure for everyone to change again! Not only that, the actual energy costs of lighting are already very low. This just adds more government regulation for very little real gain.              If the government wants to tax CO2 production fine, but then let the consumer make their own decisions."
#,Ban Tobacco Adverts,Ban Tobacco Adverts,"There is a proposal for a law to outlaw the advertising of tobacco on television. Although it would remain legal to advertise on billboards and other means, a TV ban is seen as a potential way to reduce smoking by our citizens."
#,Ban Tobacco Adverts_0,Reject Ban,"There is no direct 100% proven evidence that tobacco is anywhere near as harmful as some pressure groups claim. Millions of our citizens enjoy a smoke without any serious ill effects, and this is an example of the 'nanny state' trying to tell people what to do. It's their bodies, and their decision!"
#,Ban Tobacco Adverts_1,Approve Ban,"Smoking kills millions of people prematurely every year, and is highly addictive. Any steps the government can take towards reducing the number of people suffering smoking related illness is welcome. People will still have the right to smoke, but this reduces the chances of the next generation taking it up."
#,BLASPHEMY,Blasphemy,A website has become popular which is highly critical of a religion followed by a cross section of our society. Religious leaders have described the site as blasphemy and demanded that it be taken down. There have been violent protests outside government offices demanding action.
#,BLASPHEMY_0,Ban the site,This site is highly offensive and we should take into account the views of our ethnic minorities. Its entirely reasonable to restrict the publication of material like this which is likely to cause a public disturbance. Take down the site.
#,BLASPHEMY_1,Take no action,"You cannot give in to the demands of a small group of extremists demanding that we ban a website. Before we know it there will be capitalists wanting to ban online archives of Karl Marx. Freedom to express peoples views, even if those views are controversial is one of the basic freedoms of our society."
#,ChildLabourLaw,Child labor law,Too many of our younger citizens are leaving school early in order to take up low paying jobs. Some are even skipping school to work full time when they should be learning. The law is currently very weak with regards to preventing companies from employing under 16s in full time positions. This proposed law would make it a criminal offence to knowingly employ someone under 16 for more than 5 hours a week.
#,ChildLabourLaw_0,Criminalize child labor,"We can make speeches about how children should be in school until we are blue in the face, but unless we back up our words with legislation and  the threat of criminal action, our children will continue skipping school to earn money. We must back this law for the sake of the children!"
#,ChildLabourLaw_1,Leave law unchanged,"This law is unnecessary. The children who are skipping school are unlikely to be those who would pay attention in class anyway, and they are contributing to the economy by working instead. Also we are running the risk of criminalizing small businessmen who may not know the age of the people they employ on a casual basis."
#,ChildLabourLaw_2,Compromise,"There are good arguments on both sides, so lets compromise and just tighten the law slightly so that the children can work no more than ten hours a week. That makes everybody happy right?"
#,CHILDRENS FOOD,Children's Food,"A law has been proposed to regulate the fat,salt and sugar content and nutritional value of food sold to children, including food sold in fast food restaurants and of course, food served in schools. This is likely to incur costs for the food retailers."
#,CHILDRENS FOOD_0,Leave law unchanged,"You cannot interfere with the free market. This is the state interfering in peoples lives. If kids want to eat fatty junk food and the parents do not mind, then who are politicians to tell people not to eat hamburgers?"
#,CHILDRENS FOOD_1,Regulate Children's Food,"Obesity is a major problem, which has a severe impact on peoples health. Marketing unhealthy food to people at such an early age is unacceptable and we should pass the law now to safeguard the future health of our citizens"
#,ClimateChangeProtocol,Climate Change Protocol,"The  United Nations Climate Change Conference signed a new protocol to limit the emission of greenhouse gases in industrialized countries. Your country participated in the talks and drove a hard bargain in order not to put too much strain on the economy. Still, ratifying the protocol can be costly, limiting GDP growth and worker productivity. On the other hand, experts claim that this is the only way to save the environment. Do we ratify the protocol?"
#,ClimateChangeProtocol_0,Ratify protocol,Reducing greenhouse gas emmission is a necessary step to make sure our children will be born on a habitable planet. A small hit to the economy is well worth this goal.
#,ClimateChangeProtocol_1,Do not ratify,"With our economy at stake, we can not ratify a proposal that prevents growth, productivity and wealth. Other means of protecting the environment have to suffice for now."
#,ClusterBombBan,Cluster Bomb Ban,"An engineering company in our country has just won a contract to manufacture and supply cluster bombs for foreign countries. At the moment there is no specific law that prohibits the company from making these products, but there is widespread public debate that we should ban the production of cluster bombs within our borders."
#,ClusterBombBan_0,Ban Cluster Bombs,Cluster Bombs cause so many civilian deaths that there really is no way we should condone the manufacture of such weapons. They are a cruel weapon and there is no justification for their use today. If banning these weapons costs us a handful of jobs then that's a price we should be happy to pay.
#,ClusterBombBan_1,Reject law,"It's very easy to say we should ban the manufacture of cluster bombs, but what next? stop making guns? handcuffs? This would be a step towards dismantling our whole arms industry which would cost jobs and hurt investor confidence. It's not the job of the state to interfere in what products a company manufactures."
#,CondemnFarLeftDictator,Condemn Far Left Dictator,"Although it may seem irrelevant to our domestic politics, the extreme actions taken by a far-left dictator in another country have become such a news story that the media are expecting you to make a comment on whether you condemn their actions. The dictator has been rounding up opponents and there are reports of public executions, and beatings in the streets."
#,CondemnFarLeftDictator_0,Condemn the dictator,"It would be shocking for us not to speak out when we are well aware of the horrors taking place in this country. We normally stay out of foreign internal politics, but we cannot stand by while innocent people are arrested and even killed. To stay silent shows a lack of principles."
#,CondemnFarLeftDictator_1,Refuse to comment,"Horrible though these events may appear on the surface, it is not our duty or our place to criticize the internal politics of other countries. We do not want other countries leaders to start meddling in our own affairs. For all we know, the people being arrested are all dangerous terrorists."
#,CondemnRefuseStrike,Condemn Refuse Strike,"Refuse collection workers are on strike in a dispute over pay. The trash is starting to pile up in the streets, and people are understandably annoyed. The strike is legal, but there are health concerns, and pressure for you to comment."
#,CondemnRefuseStrike_0,Support the strikers,"It is a fundamental right of all workers to withdraw their labor in a legal industrial dispute. If people are so angry about the trash in the streets, then maybe they realize how important these people are, and should agree that those carrying out this unappealing work should be better paid."
#,CondemnRefuseStrike_1,Condemn the strike.,"This is not a reasonable way to push for higher wages. Its a health hazard, and we should look into replacing the workers with other people if needed. This is nothing more than an extremist union trying to create a nuisance to push for an unfair wage that ordinary people have to pay for. This is not highly skilled work, and the current wages are fine."
#,CONTROVERSIAL MARCH,Controversial march,An extreme right wing political group is planning a march through our capital city. The group has strong racist tendencies and the police are convinced that if the march goes ahead there will be violent confrontations between the marchers and people who will show up to oppose them. The police recommend banning the march.
#,CONTROVERSIAL MARCH_0,Ban the march,The police have given us a good enough reason to ban this march. We must take into account the views of the vast majority of our society who do not want or need the violence and trouble this march will cause. Freedom of speech does not mean freedom to riot. Ban this march.
#,CONTROVERSIAL MARCH_1,Allow the march,"One of the basic freedoms in our society must be the right to freely assemble and put forward a political view, even if it is an unpopular or minority view. The marchers are only expressing their views, and opponents are free to make a peaceful protest. It is an awkward situation but banning a political demonstration is a very dictatorial thing to do."
#,CorporateManslaughter,Corporate Manslaughter Bill,A new bill is proposed that will allow a corporate entity to be prosecuted for manslaughter when they have been found guilty of negligence resulting in loss of life.
#,CorporateManslaughter_0,Pass the law,"This law is necessary to deter companies from cutting corners when it comes to the safety of their employees and members of the public. Too many people die every year in industrial accidents, and often there are no lessons learned and no blame apportioned. This law will be a step forward for corporate responsibility."
#,CorporateManslaughter_1,Block this law,"This law is unenforceable. With large companies employing many subcontractors, the legal complexities involved in applying blame for accidents are considerable. This law may be well intentioned, but in practice it will be an expensive waste of time that serves to line the pockets of lawyers whilst failing to achieve any real change in corporate behavior."
#,CorporateMedicalMarketing,Corporate Medical Marketing,"For many years, certain pharma companies have been giving money and other favors to doctors who prescribe their drugs even though sometimes these drugs were not needed or not the ideal choice. This has increased in recent months and while no physical harm has been done so far, it is only a question of time until something bad happens."
#,CorporateMedicalMarketing_0,Take no action,"This has been going on for many years and nothing happened. Clearly there is no need to intervene and force regulations upon these companies. After all, the pharma industry is a rich and influential business, if other companies think their product is better, they can do the same."
#,CorporateMedicalMarketing_1,Introduce regulations,"This has to stop, the lives of patients are on the line and it is unacceptable that doctors prescribe medicines based on their own financial motivations rather than what the patient needs. Regulations will be put in place to prevent pharma companies influencing doctors in any financial way."
#,DebtProtectionLaw,Debt Protection Law,Debt collection agencies have been in the news because of the aggresive methods they are using to extract payment from people who owe large sums of money. These debt collection agencies provide credit to people whom larger more respectable companies will not lend money. A law is proposed to limit the ways in which such agencies can operate.
#,DebtProtectionLaw_0,Limit agency activity,"These agencies are preying on the weakest and poorest in our society, often tricking them into borrowing money at exorbitant rates that can never be repaid. This is little more than extortion and the government should act at once to limit severely the activities of such unscrupulous companies."
#,DebtProtectionLaw_1,Allow agencies to operate,"Nobody forces people to borrow money they can't repay, and to restrict the rights of debt agencies to recover legitimate debts would be counter productive. People need to learn to live within their means and not expect the state to bail them out of trouble if they cannot learn to do so."
#,DecryPaydayLoanCompany,Decry Payday Loan Company,"Short term or 'payday' loan companies are offering loans at extremely high interest rates, and targeting the poorest in society due to their lack of access to mainstream lenders. Some consumer campaigners are demanding that the government speak out on this issue."
#,DecryPaydayLoanCompany_0,Criticize the loans,"Surely it is unacceptable that those in society in the most desperate need of credit are charged the highest rates? These companies are cynically exploiting the limited options of the poor, and trapping them forever in a cycle of debt. At the very least we should be openly critical of their business model."
#,DecryPaydayLoanCompany_1,Make no comment,"These lenders are running perfectly legal businesses that simply cater to a certain market. Of course those who are very high-risk customers are going to be charged higher interest rates, that's perfectly understandable. Plus, it is better to allow legal, and regulated pay-day lenders than allow criminals and loan-sharks to take over."
#,DeliveryDrones,Delivery Drones,"An international retailer wants to introduce delivery of shipments by autonomous cargo quadrocopters. The general public is excited by this prospect, but trade unionists are highly critical, predicting job losses and accidents. The retailer requested permission to start a pilot project and current legislature does not cover commercial drones."
#,DeliveryDrones_0,Allow delivery drones,"The pilot program will not offer drone delivery to customers, just from one depot to the next. The technology is safe enough to allow that."
#,DeliveryDrones_1,Disallow delivery drones,"With police drones and military drones, public airspace is already getting crowded. Private drones would unnecessarily increase the risk drone-related of accidents."
#,DeliveryDrones_2,Allow Limited Trials,Lets not run into this. Maybe its best to just allow some limited trials for a year or two to see what happens?
#,DisguisedEmploymentLaw,Disguised Employment Law,"There has been a substantial rise in the number of zero-hour gig-economy businesses such as taxi-apps in recent years, and the law has failed to catch up. Some campaigners say that this is disguised employment, designed to avoid providing holiday or sick pay to employees, and that the companies need to be treated as regular employers."
#,DisguisedEmploymentLaw_0,Declare gig-economy jobs as disguised employment,"These companies are basically high-tech taxi and delivery companies making use of a loophole to prevent themselves paying sick pay, pension contributions and other basic entitlements. Its unfair competition to those who play by the spirit of the law. Tightening the regulations will allow for fair competition."
#,DisguisedEmploymentLaw_1,Leave current regulations alone,"This is simply how the free market works. A new business model, which provides extremely flexible employment to thousands of people, and allows for super low cost taxis and food delivery has simply out-competed legacy businesses. The workers are entirely free to switch off the apps or work for competitors, so its perfectly true to say this is not normal employment."
#,DNADatabase,DNA Database,"Police chiefs are requesting that they be allowed to build up a global database of everyone's DNA to assist them in fighting crime. DNA evidence allows many previously unsolvable crimes to be tracked to the perpetrators, although there are privacy concerns."
#,DNADatabase_0,Allow database,"This is likely to be an invaluable weapon in the fight against crime. For too long, criminals have been able to deny responsibility for their crimes, and with DNA evidence we can substantially cut police time used to locate criminals such as murderers and rapists. Unless people have something to hide, they cannot possibly oppose such a measure."
#,DNADatabase_1,Prevent database,"This is a fundamental breach of our citizens human rights. We have to maintain an individuals presumption of innocence till proven guilty, and building up a 'big brother' style database of everyone makes us all feel like criminals. Are we really going to 'force' our citizens to provide DNA samples to the state or face jail?"
#,DNADatabase_2,Criminal Only Database,"Lets take a practical approach. DNA taken from suspects can be held indefinitely on a police database, but there should be no widespread collection of innocent peoples DNA unless they are charged with an offence."
#,EndLifeRecyclingLaw,End Life Recycling Law,"One of the downsides to a consumer society is that so many products end up just thrown into landfill at the end of their life. One solution is to encourage people to recycle, but recently there is a push to place this burden on the manufacturers of large domestic appliances, giving them a legal duty to take back their old products and recycle them."
#,EndLifeRecyclingLaw_0,Pass Law,"We cannot continue just throwing more and more stuff into holes in the ground and hoping it will go away. By forcing the recycling burden back onto companies, it will encourage them to design products that are easily and cheaply recycled, which means everybody wins."
#,EndLifeRecyclingLaw_1,Reject Law,"It sounds simple in practice, but this would place a huge burden on companies and manufacturers based in our country. We cannot enforce this overseas, meaning we are simply placing a pointless regulatory burden on our own industry."
#,EXTRADITE TERROR SUSPECT,Extradite terror Suspect?,"A middle east country with which we have no formal extradition treaty has requested that we extradite an immigrant living here to them to face charges of terrorism. They accuse him of being responsible for car bombings in their capital city, but the only evidence they have of this is the confessions of other terror suspects, which may have been made under 'duress'."
#,EXTRADITE TERROR SUSPECT_0,Extradite suspect,"We should send this terrorist back to his home country immediately. There may be some minor concerns about the justice system in his home country, but they are fighting terrorists, and if the situation were reversed we would be outraged at any refusal to send terrorists to face trial. This is no time to be squeamish about interrogation methods."
#,EXTRADITE TERROR SUSPECT_1,Keep him here,"If we extradite this man there is a chance he will face the death penalty. We have no way of knowing if he will get a fair trial, and we cannot be sure that he is the right man. We cannot extradite people just on the say-so of foreign governments, we need to see evidence of criminal activity before we possibly send a man to his death."
#,FactoryFarming,Factory Farming Law,"A campaign for the tightening of animal welfare standards on farms is gaining momentum. A law has been proposed that would set higher minimum standards for the space, food and access to outdoors that is available to animals in intensive farming establishments."
#,FactoryFarming_0,Set tougher standards,"It's about time we did something to ensure animals are not suffering in intensive farming. Most people would be horrified if they saw the conditions some animals are kept in. These standards would lead to more expensive food, but people would be happy to pay more if they knew the conditions in which animals are currently kept."
#,FactoryFarming_1,Leave unchanged,"Nobody forces people to buy processed meat from the cheapest source. There are organic and free range foods, but the free market shows clearly that people aren't prepared to pay more for a change in animal welfare. This is the government interfering in the market to appease a few campaigners."
#,FishingQuota,Fishing Quotas,Marine conservation groups are pushing for us to sign international laws restricting the quantity of certain fish that can be caught by our fishermen in any calendar year. This is an attempt to preserve the viability of fish stocks for future generations.
#,FishingQuota_0,Agree to Quotas,"This is just common sense. Modern technology has meant it has become far too cheap and easy to catch huge numbers of fish, reducing prices and causing a dangerous depletion in supply. It might be unpopular with the fishermen in the short term, but in the long run, we have to think of the marine environment. Environmental groups recommend signing the law."
#,FishingQuota_1,Reject Quotas,"In theory it all sounds very sensible, but in practice do we want to sign away control of our fishing economy to some international body? And although we can be sure our fishermen will abide by the deal, how can we be sure foreign fishermen will do the same? Signing this law is just going to be another nail in the coffin of the fishing trade, and its going to cost jobs! Reject the law!"
#,FlagBurning,Flag Burning Law,"A proposal has been made to make it a specific criminal offence to burn the flag of our nation. Patriots are concerned that people are whipping up anti-government hysteria by burning the flag of our nation in public, with the police powerless to act."
#,FlagBurning_0,Ban flag burning,"Many people are insulted by the thought of people burning the flag of their nation. The flag does not represent a specific political party, it represents the country itself. Burning the flag is a deeply unpatriotic act and anyone who would do such a thing should not be in this country in the first place."
#,FlagBurning_1,Allow flag burning,"We cannot claim to be a free society whilst at the same time denying the right of people who oppose our government to express that view, even if that means burning the flag. At the end of the day, the flag is just a peace of cloth and how can we make it a criminal offence to burn a piece of cloth?"
#,ForeignPresident,Foreign Presidential Visit,"The president of a nation with a fast growing economy has invited you to an official state visit. The visit could be an excellent opportunity to encourage trade with that country which would be great for jobs, but the country's record on human rights is highly questionable."
#,ForeignPresident_0,Turn down offer,"This foreign leader has an appalling record on both human rights, and attitudes to minorities within his country. There will be widespread anger amongst both ethnic minorities, and human rights campaigners here, and in the international community if you carry out the visit, which is effectively an endorsement of this mans brutal policies."
#,ForeignPresident_1,Accept offer,"The visit should go ahead. Firstly it would be great for the economy, potentially creating jobs amongst the very minorities who oppose the visit, secondly we cannot possibly influence the behavior of other nations if we refuse even to meet with their leaders."
#,Fracking,Fracking,"Hydraulic fracturing, better known as 'fracking' is a drilling technology that allows energy companies to exploit previously unreachable deposits of shale gas. The technique is relatively new, and requires the government to give permission to use. On the one hand it opens up potentially huge supplies of energy, on the other hand, there are serious environmental concerns about the process."
#,Fracking_0,Allow Fracking,"This bill will give the go-ahead to energy companies to carry out commercial level fracking operations on our soil. This is great news for consumers as it will drive energy prices down, and will reduce our dependence on foreign imports of oil and gas. Plus it will be a boost for the economy. what's not to like?"
#,Fracking_1,Ban fracking,"Fracking poses a number of dangers, not least the possibility that it is linked to earthquakes, and the very real danger of contaminating the water supply, as it involves pumping huge quantities of dangerous chemicals into the rock at very high pressures. Plus, this is just another way to perpetuate our reliance on ever dwindling supplies of climate-damaging fossil fuels."
#,Freedomofinformation,Freedom of information,"There have been calls for a law to increase the availability of information held on databases about citizens without their knowledge. These include the records held by private medical companies, insurance companies and debt collection agencies, as well as information held by government departments."
#,Freedomofinformation_0,Reject proposal,"Nobody likes the idea of the government holding information about them, but in some circumstances this needs to be done. The government isn't out to spy on everyone, but passing this law will just make it harder for the intelligence services to keep a watch on serious criminals and terrorists. It will also affect a large number of businesses who have customer databases, who will be swamped with yet more bureaucracy."
#,Freedomofinformation_1,Propose freedom act,"It's essential that we have this law passed as it is one of the checks and balances required in any truly free society. The average law abiding citizen should not be spied on or monitored by multinational corporations with computer databases, and the potential for abuse by government agencies if the citizens cannot view what data is being stored is huge."
#,GayAdoption,Gay Adoption,There is currently a highly publicized court case where a same-sex couple are claiming they are being discriminated against because they have been waiting so long for a child to adopt. Its time you told the public where you stand in this debate.
#,GayAdoption_0,Support gay adoption,"Its heartbreaking to think that a loving couple, desperate to adopt a child could be treated with such discrimination by public servants. We should enforce in law the principle that same sex couples should be treated no differently to anybody else by our adoption service."
#,GayAdoption_1,Oppose gay adoption,"Obviously the most important thing is the welfare of the child, not scoring points with political pressure groups or movements. The simple fact is that a child is better off raised by a mother and a father. Its absolutely fair that heterosexual couples are prioritized by the adoption service."
#,GenderNeutralRestrooms,Gender Neutral Restrooms,"There is a campaign for the law to be changed to ensure all premises above a certain size make provision for gender-neutral restrooms, for non-binary citizens to use without fear of harassment."
#,GenderNeutralRestrooms_0,Require gender-neutral restrooms,"This proposal would never be required if society was more tolerant of our non binary citizens, but sadly they face such harassment and discrimination that something has to be done. Its really not much to ask in order to provide a safe environment for all, regardless of gender."
#,GenderNeutralRestrooms_1,Make no change,"This proposal is ridiculous, and amounts frankly to pandering to a tiny percentage of the population. The changes would cost huge amounts for owners of businesses, and is a classic example of the government interfering where it is not needed. Can't we just let people make their own decisions as to which restroom is appropriate?"
#,GMFood,GM Food proposal,A number of large agricultural companies are interested in growing genetically modified (GM) food on our soil. Some food can be genetically manipulated to allow for longer shelf life and both disease and herbicide resistance. Opponents are concerned about the potential risks associated with altering the food chain. Farmers are divided on the issue.
#,GMFood_0,Allow GM crops,"GM crops have huge potential benefits. Not only do they increase shelf life and thus reduce costs for the sellers, but they can also reduce the need for pesticides, thus meaning less harmful chemicals in use during their production. It's also possible for foods to be created with other benefits such as improved vitamin content."
#,GMFood_1,Ban the sale of GM food,"There is no need for GM food. The benefits are great for the producers, but not for the consumers. We simply do not know enough about the long term effects of genetically modifying the food chain. Scientific research is all well and good, but once released into the environment, these organisms cannot be recalled. We should act now to protect the food chain from GM."
#,Hackers,Hackers breaching critical systems,"A group of expert hackers has hacked critical systems in our computer networks, including power plants and banking. The group went public and admitted to the hack, pointing out some dangerous flaws in our defenses and offering ways to fix the problems. Companies and security experts are now on high alert and demand action."
#,Hackers_0,Arrest these criminals,"Hacking these systems could have caused a catastrophe. The flaws in the system need to be fixed as quickly as possible and the hackers arrested, otherwise other hackers will attempt this again, causing immense stress on our networks in the hopes of becoming famous."
#,Hackers_1,Hire them,"These hackers seem to be the best in their field, so they should be perfect to keep our systems safe and work on new methods to prevent future incidents like that. Companies and state-employees won't like it, but security comes first here."
#,HOSTAGE SITUATION,Hostage Situation,"A group of religious extremists have taken some hostages at gunpoint and are threatening to kill them unless demands regarding foreign policy are not met. The demands they make are not that extreme, but it might be dangerous to be seen to negotiate."
#,HOSTAGE SITUATION_0,Give in to demands,"The best thing we can do here is to be reasonable and give in at least partially to their demands. That way we can ensure nobody gets hurt, and the situation doesn't spiral out of control. Taking extreme action against these people could only cause racial tension."
#,HOSTAGE SITUATION_1,Send in the police,"There is no negotiating with hostage takers. To do so would open the floodgates to total chaos. Its unfortunate for those citizens taken hostage, but we need to storm the building right now and try and get those people freed. If that means shooting the hostage takers and losing a few hostages, that's the price we have to pay."
#,HousingExpansion,Housing Expansion,"There is a shortage of homes in our country, and the government is under pressure to relax planning laws and allow previously restricted 'green-belt' land to be built on."
#,HousingExpansion_0,Relax planning law,"House prices  are rising far faster than earnings, due mainly to the shortage of supply. In the long term, the only solution is to build more housing. It's no good providing housing where there are no jobs, and if that means building on a small proportion of 'green-belt' land then that's a price we have to pay."
#,HousingExpansion_1,Keep planning restrictions,"There is always pressure to build new homes on 'green field sites', because housing companies find it cheaper and easier to build on them. There are plenty of urban sites that should be reused before we resort to carving up the countryside. A sudden expansion into the green belt would have a dreadful impact on the rural communities."
#,HUNGER STRIKE,Hunger strike,"A convicted terrorist has gone on hunger strike demanding he be allowed visits from people thought to be associated with terrorist groups. We do not have the evidence to arrest his colleagues, and are currently banning all visits for this prisoner, but it looks like he will go through with his hunger strike threat and may well die in his cell."
#,HUNGER STRIKE_0,Allow visits,"We might not like this man or what he stands for but we cannot allow him to die in a cell. Doing so would only reduce us to the level of the terrorist, and would also almost certainly make a martyr out of him. We should let him have visitors whilst in prison."
#,HUNGER STRIKE_1,Prevent visits,"You do not negotiate with terrorists. Its as simple as that. They will only perceive any negotiation or relaxation of the rules on our part as a sign of weakness. If he dies in prison, then that's his decision and we should not be concerned."
#,IllegalImmigrationAmnesty,Illegal Immigration Amnesty,"Everyone knows we have illegal immigrants in our country. A proposal has been put that we should offer existing immigrants an amnesty and welcome them as proper citizens, who can work and pay tax like anybody else."
#,IllegalImmigrationAmnesty_0,Refuse amnesty,"An amnesty might be tempting for tax and law-and-order reasons, but it sends a terrible message. People who broke our laws and came here illegally should never be rewarded for doing so. This would just lead to yet more illegal immigration from people hoping the same happens to them."
#,IllegalImmigrationAmnesty_1,Offer amnesty,"However tough or relaxed we are on current immigration policy, it doesn't change the status of people already here. Many illegal immigrants have worked and lived here for years, and it simply makes economic sense, and improves social cohesion to grant them citizenship. That means less black-market work, and more tax, a double-win."
#,ImprovedTenancyRights,Improved Tenancy Rights,"There is currently a proposal to increase the rights of tenants in rented accommodation. The fear of being suddenly thrown out of your home, or having your rent raised to unaffordable levels, or waiting ages for repairs is making rented accommodation extremely undesirable and tenants are demanding something is done."
#,ImprovedTenancyRights_0,Keep current rights,"The rental market is a good example of a free market, where landlords will compete for the best tenants, and tenants can pick and choose their homes based on price, location and reputation. There is no need for further burdensome legislation here. If tenants find a landlord to be offering bad service, they are free to move to other premises."
#,ImprovedTenancyRights_1,Improved Tenants rights,Many people simply cannot afford the deposit to buy a house and are resigned to renting their whole lives. the lack of decent protections from random eviction or rent increases mean these people never have the peace of mind or stability that homeowners enjoy. Landlords who take their duties seriously have nothing to fear from sensible improvements to the law.
#,IncreasedSchoolInspections,Increased School Inspections,There are concerns that school standards are slipping and that the current regime for examining teaching methods and schools is not sufficient. Campaigners suggest a toughening up of the system with much more frequent inspections.
#,IncreasedSchoolInspections_0,Increase Inspections,"Education is a service like any other, and its essential that parents know what they are getting for their money or taxes. Decent teachers should have nothing to fear from extra scrutiny. What parent would oppose greater checks on the way in which their children were being educated?"
#,IncreasedSchoolInspections_1,Keep current system,"Teaching children is difficult enough as it is, as well as being poorly paid and undertaken by dedicated professionals. This proposal would simply heap extra bureaucracy and take more time away from actual teaching. Its insulting to suggest that dedicated public service workers like teachers need further scrutiny."
#,InternetTracking,Internet Tracking,"The increasing capability of large corporations to use customer databases and 'big data' to analyze consumer behavior has led to concerns about privacy. The companies insist that such data is anonymous in many cases and is being used purely to provide a better service, whereas campaigners suggest big faceless corporations are creating 'big brother' style databases of consumers without their consent."
#,InternetTracking_0,Ban Tracking,"This sort of behavior is nothing short of creepy, as well as posing a potential risk of identity theft for consumers. Companies have managed well enough all these years without tracking and storing information on every single decision a customer makes, and can easily get by without it. People have the right to buy things without effectively being followed by digital spies wherever they go."
#,InternetTracking_1,Allow Tracking,"Opponents of internet tracking make it sound far more sinister than it is. All we are talking about is allowing companies to record accurate information on consumer preferences so they can make better products and target their advertising effectively, something that is harmless and also essential to a modern economy. There is no real cry for the government to intervene here."
#,InternetTracking_2,Warn Users,"Banning tracking goes too far, but its important that citizens are aware when they are being tracked. maybe a system of convenient pop-up windows when visiting a website that tell people they are being tracked is the best solution for everybody?"
#,KeepRuralBanks,Keep Rural Banks,"As more people switch to telephone or Internet banking, the major banks are closing small rural branches. These branches are still used by many elderly people in rural communities, and campaigners want the government to force these rural banks to stay open."
#,KeepRuralBanks_0,Force banks to stay open,"To younger people, bank branches may seem redundant, but many older citizens actually prefer to use their local banks, which also serve as a vital part of rural communities. Closing down local banks will be a bitter blow for small communities and is best avoided."
#,KeepRuralBanks_1,Allow banks to close,"This is not the 1900s! The idea that we still need physical banks in the age of the Internet is ridiculous. Sooner or later all of our citizens will be comfortable with using the Internet. Besides, is it really fair on the banks shareholders to somehow force them to keep money-losing branches open?"
#,Laborday,Labor Day Festivities,"Festivities for the next Labor Day are being planned. Traditionally you would be giving a speech in front of the trade unions, but you have also been invited to the opening ceremony of a new industrial complex by foreign investors, that will strengthen the economy of the region and create many low income jobs."
#,Laborday_0,Hold the speech in front of the trade unions,"Labor Day is the day of the working class and their trade unions, holding a speech in front of them is a tradition and a big honor. Workers face many troubles in these insecure times and need to be reassured by the government that we are on their side and keeping their work places is a top priority."
#,Laborday_1,Join the foreign investors,"While it is certainly important to tend to the needs of the trade unions, it is also important to create more jobs and a key to that are foreign investors. Joining them will show our appreciation and will cause them and other countries to invest more here. We'll join the trade unions again next year."
#,LayWreathForGeneral,Lay Wreath For General,"One of our longest serving military generals has died, and you must decide whether to lay a wreath at his funeral. The general was definitely a military hero, but was dogged by accusations of racism, misogyny and bullying towards the end of his career."
#,LayWreathForGeneral_0,Lay the wreath,"In honoring the man at his funeral, we are not condoning what he became later in life, but simply paying respects to a man who was clearly prepared to put his life on the line for his country. Not to lay a wreath would be cheap virtue signaling that will insult our troops and disgrace the uniform they wear."
#,LayWreathForGeneral_1,Do not lay a wreath.,"The behavior of this man in the later part of his life cannot be excused, no matter what he did in his career. To be seen visibly honoring someone who behaved so badly simply shows contempt for ethnic minorities, women, and those he harassed and bullied. We must not be seen to support such behavior."
#,LGBTLessonsInSchool,LGBT Lessons In School,"Sex education in school is always a political football, and now its back in play as the issue of educating children about the existence of same-sex couples and relationships has hit the news. You have to take a stand on whether or not to support LGBT topics in school lessons."
#,LGBTLessonsInSchool_0,Support LGBT teaching,"The whole point of school is to educate and prepare children for the real world, and obviously same-sex relationships are part of society. Imagine the point of view of the child who questions their own sexuality. Surely its best for them to learn the truth from school teachers without pressure from religious leaders of parents with extreme views?"
#,LGBTLessonsInSchool_1,Oppose LGBT teaching,"Are children not overwhelmed and confused enough about sex and relationships without us introducing extreme liberal propaganda about gender fluidity into the mix? School is not the place to get bogged down in these issues, and school-children are too young to be questioning their gender anyway."
#,Merger,Merger,"A large internet company has announced plans to buy out one of its main competitors. This merger needs government approval, but if it goes ahead it will create one of the biggest companies in the country."
#,Merger_0,Allow merger,"There is no good reason to prevent this merger. In an increasingly global market, our companies need to grow if they are to compete successfully. The bigger company will be more efficient and effective in the global marketplace."
#,Merger_1,Block merger,"The whole idea of the free market is based on competition. Allowing these two firms to merge will reduce both competition, and consumer choice and no doubt lead to redundancies. Its another example of government looking after big business and forgetting the little guy. Small businesses and trade unionists urge you to block this merger."
#,OilDrilling,Oil Drilling Opportunity,Oil companies are keen to get permission to drill for oil in part of the country protected as a wildlife refuge. The oil supplies under the refuge are considerable but the drilling would have a negative impact on the environment.
#,OilDrilling_0,Allow Drilling,"There are literally billions of barrels of oil right here on our soil, and current law is preventing us from drilling for it. Instead, we are importing oil from other countries. The environmental impact will be minimal when you consider the gains that drilling makes in terms of energy security. Nobody wants to spoil the environment, but the alternative is reliance on foreign oil."
#,OilDrilling_1,Prevent Drilling,"This valuable wildlife refuge would be devastated by oil exploration. This is one of our nations great national treasures, and it would be criminal to wreck it just to boost domestic oil production. Drilling in this part of the country will not entirely remove our dependence on foreign oil, but it will spoil our natural environment for future generations."
#,PeopleSmuggling,People Smuggling,"A large number of people have been caught entering our country hidden inside cargo containers, in an organized attempt at people-smuggling. The criminals who masterminded the scheme have been arrested, but there is debate as to whether those people who are now on our shores should be sent back to their country of origin."
#,PeopleSmuggling_0,Allow them to stay,"There is strong evidence that these people were desperate to flee persecution, poverty or even death in their own country. These are desperate people as we can see from the lengths they went to in order to get here. It would be inhumane to deport them now they are here."
#,PeopleSmuggling_1,Deport them,"Letting these people stay would send out entirely the wrong signal to people who want to come here illegally. We have enough of a problem with illegal economic migrants as it is. Unfortunate though it may be, the only sensible choice is to send them back."
#,POSITIVE DISCRIMINATION,Positive Discrimination,"There are calls for a law to expressly set quotas for the employment of ethnic and other minorities by large corporations and government institutions. This would put pressure on companies to give higher priority to some job candidates than others on the basis of their race, sex or age."
#,POSITIVE DISCRIMINATION_0,Pass law,"We need this law. In economic terms it makes no sense for people below or above a certain age to be rendered unemployable. Also, in human rights terms, this is much needed compensation for years of discrimination in the workplace against ethnic minorities, women, the elderly and the disabled."
#,POSITIVE DISCRIMINATION_1,Reject law,"This is a deeply flawed law. It makes no sense to fight discrimination by using discrimination. It creates two problems, that of the minority members who feel they may not have achieved the position on merit, and the resentment of the potential employee who was denied the job."
#,Powerlines,Powerlines,"Angry citizens are protesting against a project to build power lines through their villages. These power lines are necessary to further increase use of renewable energy sources. Not building them would be an economic setback, but if you ignore the citizens, this will make then even angrier and supportive of their cause."
#,Powerlines_0,Build power lines anyway,"Nobody wants power lines next to their houses, but they have to be built somewhere. And until recently, these people have been demanding more clean energy. The power lines will be built."
#,Powerlines_1,Stop construction,"There are alternative ways to explore, like underground power lines. And there are claims that the health of those living near power lines may be in danger. It is better to be safe than sorry."
#,PublicLandLaw,Public Land Law,"Much of our country is still privately owned, with access to walk on the land restricted by the landowners. There is a strong campaign to bring in laws forcing landowners to make their land accessible to ramblers and walkers to enjoy the countryside within certain guidelines."
#,PublicLandLaw_0,Block this law,"Private land is private land. This is the very basis of private ownership and capitalism. If the owners wish to restrict access to their land, this is entirely up to them. This is nothing more than a thinly disguised class war attempt by disgruntled socialists."
#,PublicLandLaw_1,Support the law,"It's crazy to have so much open and often entirely unused land in private hands while our cities are so overcrowded. This law will allow all citizens to enjoy the beauty of our countryside, whilst retaining the final property rights and ownership privileges of the landowner. It's a good compromise."
#,PublicRightsOfWay,Expand Public Rights Of Way,"As we build more houses in our country, once open land that was used by walkers and hikers is increasingly becoming closed off and considered private property. Socialist campaigners have protested these changes and are calling for an expansion of protected 'public rights of way'."
#,PublicRightsOfWay_0,Take no action,"Private land is private land, regardless of whether it is farmland, industrial land or somebody's garden or yard! The idea that because people have taken a certain path for many years that they should continue to have the right to trespass on private property is ridiculous. there are plenty of public roads and parks people can make use of."
#,PublicRightsOfWay_1,Expand rights of way,So much of our country is now private property that peoples access to open countryside is worryingly restricted. Does it really matter to a farmer if a few walkers and hikers occasionally cross their land on a designated footpath? We should ensure that open countryside and footpaths are easily accessible to everybody.
#,PUBLIC SMOKING BAN,Public smoking ban,There are a number of suspected links between smoking and poor heath. Pressure groups have called for a ban on all smoking in public as an encouragement to smokers to give up.
#,PUBLIC SMOKING BAN_0,Ban public smoking,This is a major step towards cutting the number of people in this country who die from smoking related illness. It is the duty of the state to pass laws like this in the interests of peoples health.
#,PUBLIC SMOKING BAN_1,Leave law unchanged,"It's not the job of the state to tell people how they live their lives. This is a total over-reaction and an attack on civil liberties. Its legal to smoke, so you should be free to do so in public. People must be free to make their own decisions about health."
#,ReasonableForceLaw,Reasonable Force Law,"A recent court case, where a rural man shot and killed a teenage burglar in his own home has thrown a spotlight on the law regarding reasonable force when defending property, given that the homeowner was prosecuted for manslaughter."
#,ReasonableForceLaw_0,Tighten definition of reasonable force,"Nobody has the right to take the life of another, even if they are defending their property. Human life has to come before property, in all cases. We may not have much sympathy for a burglar, but allowing people to violently take the law into their own hands is certainly not the solution."
#,ReasonableForceLaw_1,Expand definition of reasonable force,"Its clearly ridiculous that a frightened man, far from the police, attacked by a violent criminal in his own home would ever be arrested, let alone charged, even if the criminal dies in the struggle. We need to clarify that every citizen has the right to use force to defend their property, regardless of what happens."
#,ReasonableForceLaw_2,Unquestioned right to defend property.,"We should make it clear that the police will turn a blind eye to whatever means homeowners employ to defend themselves. If some burglar gets machinegunned in another persons kitchen, well thats just karma."
#,ReligiousSymbols,Religious Symbols In Schools,"There is pressure for us to introduce a law to ban the wearing of religious symbols in state schools by students. This would include wearing the hijab by female Muslim students, and the wearing of a cross by Christian students."
#,ReligiousSymbols_0,Introduce the ban,"School is a place for children to learn, not to display religious allegiance. By ensuring all students dress the same, we can ensure there is equality and integration of all religions, with no discrimination. This is the logical extension of the separation of religion and state. People are free to dress how they like in churches and mosques, but not in state schools."
#,ReligiousSymbols_1,Reject the ban,"This is nothing short of discrimination against Muslims. Nobody really expects this law to be used to prevent the wearing of Christian crosses, it exists purely as an excuse to ban Muslim students from dressing as they wish. This will cause division and segregation, and is a recipe for religious tension in schools."
#,RoyalScandal,Royal Scandal,"A prominent member of the royal family has been accused of spending a suspicious amount of time with a convicted sex offender, despite that individuals sordid history being well-known. This is being described as at-best 'poor judgement' and at worst, deeply suspicious. How will your government react?"
#,RoyalScandal_0,Support the monarch,"Nobody expects the government of the day to openly criticize the monarch. It would likely lead to major constitutional 'difficulties' and would be considered deeply unpatriotic. We should issue a statement that the allegations remain simply allegations, and that this is merely guilt by association."
#,RoyalScandal_1,Criticize the monarch,"How can we possibly stand by and let this happen without comment? Nobody expects your government to call for the royal families abolition, but at the very least a strongly worded statement to the effect that such behavior is 'unacceptable' would be appropriate, regardless of what the royalists and patriots may think."
#,RuleOutFirstStrike,Rule Out First Strike,"Weapons of mass destruction are theoretically a weapon of last resort, and work purely as a deterrent. With this in mind, there is pressure for you to publicly commit to no first-use of any such weapons."
#,RuleOutFirstStrike_0,Rule out first strike,"This is simply a public way to re-iterate our purpose in possessing such weapons. We do not have any expansionary plans, so clearly such weapons exist purely as a form of defense, by deterring foreign aggression. This is also a way to encourage others to make the same claim, and could lead to less international tension and a safer world."
#,RuleOutFirstStrike_1,Make no comment,"It would be crazy for us to tie the hands of our military by announcing our strategy to the world for all to see. It is clear that our potential enemies are in no rush to make similar grandstanding announcements. If they want to rule out first strikes, let them go first. We should be in no such rush."
#,SafeguardOilSupplies,Safeguard Oil Supplies,Representatives from oil companies based in our country have requested that the government deploy troops overseas at our oil refineries in the middle east to protect them from attack by terrorists. The governments involved are happy for our troops to be stationed on their soil for this purpose.
#,SafeguardOilSupplies_0,Send the troops,"This is why we have a military, and we should not be afraid to use it. Foreign terrorists need to understand that we are prepared to take determined action to safeguard our oil supplies. This is not a 'foreign invasion', merely the provision of extra security for vital parts of our industry that happen to be overseas. If we do not deploy troops, the oil supply *will* suffer."
#,SafeguardOilSupplies_1,Do not deploy troops,"It doesn't matter what our motivation is, the symbolism of our troops landing on foreign soil, heavily armed and prepared to use deadly force, is going to cause a major backlash in some countries. Its likely this will lead to both problems with international relations and the possibility of increased terrorism. Our troops are not the security wing of the oil companies, and this is no job for them."
#,SchoolSponsorship,School Sponsorship,A number of large corporations have expressed an interest in investing in our school system. Everything from free schoolbooks to entire sports centers is offered in return for some branding and promotional opportunities.
#,SchoolSponsorship_0,Allow sponsorship,It would be crazy to turn down the offer of free educational materials. The government cannot provide the state of the art facilities that these companies are prepared to build in our schools. Having company logos on school books is a trivial price to pay for such large investment in education.
#,SchoolSponsorship_1,Prevent sponsorship,"Our schools are places for kids to be educated, not to be brainwashed in buying this or that brand of cola. Advertising is everywhere in society and schools are one of the last places we can escape from it. Keep big business out of education!"
#,SharedParentalLeave,Shared Parental Leave,"Traditionally, paid leave from work was for the mother only, but there is a proposal to make this shared so that the time can be split between both parents as they fit. This is seen as a step towards gender equality."
#,SharedParentalLeave_0,Keep for mother only,"There is simply no need for this. It only complicates the provision of parental leave, and the overwhelming majority of parents agree that the mother is the best person to take time off work to look after a new born child. This is nothing more than pandering to an agenda that tries to pretend there is no difference between the genders."
#,SharedParentalLeave_1,Allow shared leave,"It makes perfect sense these days that which parent claims the amount of paid leave after having a new child is left to the parents, rather than being determined by the state. We no longer live in a world where all parenting is done by the mother, and the current system is simply a sexist legacy of outdated points of view."
#,SingleUsePlasticBan,Single Use Plastic Ban,"Shock at the amount of plastic pollution in our water-supply, our oceans, and even in the air we breath has led to calls from scientists to ban single-use plastics entirely to get the problem of plastic pollution under control."
#,SingleUsePlasticBan_0,Ban single-use plastic,"Its absolutely ridiculous that we allow companies to use plastic packaging that will be used only once but will take maybe hundreds of years to break down, and even then may end up in our water supply. Other materials are available, and only government legislation will persuade companies to do the right thing and swap to more sustainable products."
#,SingleUsePlasticBan_1,Allow single-use plastic,"This sounds like an easy crowd-pleasing change, but the impact on industry would be massive. Like it or not, we have got used to the idea of cheap, single use plastic in many parts of our life. A ban would cause immense costs and regulatory hell for our small businesses and be an economic nightmare. Meanwhile foreign companies will use them as normal."
#,SpeedLimits,Speed Limits,A major motorist's pressure group has lobbied government to get the speed limits on our major roads raised. These speed limits were set many years ago and both car speeds and braking performance has improved since then.
#,SpeedLimits_0,Raise speed limits,"We have moved on since the times when men walked with red flags in front of motor cars. The national speed limits are stupidly low, and the limits are widely ignored. We cannot enforce the limits effectively, and until the limits are set as sensible values its just encouraging people to break the law. We need to raise the limits immediately."
#,SpeedLimits_1,No change,"Speed limits exist for a reason. Enough people die on our roads as it is, and speed is often a factor in the survivability of car accidents. Its true people break the limit as it is, but raising it now will just encourage faster, dangerous driving. Leave it unchanged."
#,SQUATTERS RIGHTS,Squatters rights,"A large empty house in one of the best neighborhoods of the capital has been taken over by homeless people. The house has been unused and empty for years, and lawyers are now arguing over whether or not the 'squatters' have a right to remain in the property. The landlord wishes to have them evicted."
#,SQUATTERS RIGHTS_0,Give property to squatters,"If people have become so wealthy that they can own multiple houses and leave some empty, whilst meanwhile we have some citizens with nowhere to live, then it is only right and fair that these homes be put to good use. The landlord has obviously had no need of the property for many years and it should be now legally given to the occupiers."
#,SQUATTERS RIGHTS_1,Evict the squatters,"Its a dangerous precedent if you effectively hand someone's property to thieves. If the owner is wealthy enough to have empty properties, then this is his decision. Nobody is preventing these 'squatters' from saving up and buying a house legally just like the landlord did. Send in the police and throw these people out."
#,STOP AND SEARCH POLICE POWERS,Stop and search,There are demands from the police for the power to stop and search people on the street if they believe that individual may be guilty of a crime. Currently our police cannot search someone without formally arresting them.
#,STOP AND SEARCH POLICE POWERS_0,Introduce powers,"This will be a valuable weapon in the fight against crime and should have a noticeable impact on violent and street crime especially. If our citizens have nothing to hide, then they have nothing to fear from this law."
#,STOP AND SEARCH POLICE POWERS_1,Leave unchanged,"This is a very dangerous move. Its wide open to abuse on racial grounds, and will further distance the police from the community. Our citizens should be free to go about their lawful business without interference from the authorities!"
#,Streamer,Streamer offers birthday song,"A popular internet streamer is offering to sing for you on your birthday in public. She is known for her tiny dresses and adult themed songs, making her very popular among young people."
#,Streamer_0,Accept the offer,This is a great honor and will help you gain popularity with young people all over the country. Let's just hope it's cold and she wears something less revealing than usual.
#,Streamer_1,Decline the offer,"She may be famous and successful, but clearly is not a role model for our youth. Let's keep this celebration small and decent, and focus on the important political issues."
#,StricterDrivingTests,Stricter Driving Tests,"There are calls to toughen up the driving test regime to ensure new drivers are much better prepared for road conditions, and to improve driver safety."
#,StricterDrivingTests_0,Toughen up the tests,"The current driving test may have been fine when cars went 20mph and before six lane highways existed, but times have changed. Drivers are increasingly distracted by mobile phones, and can drive staggeringly fast vehicles in all weather conditions with virtually no experience. For the sake of the many children run over and killed each year, we need tougher tests."
#,StricterDrivingTests_1,Make no change,"There is no need for change. If anything, cars are getting safer each year thanks to modern technology such as collision detection and crash-safety systems. It already costs a fortune and takes forever to pass a driving test. This would just be a burden for new young drivers."
#,SupportDemocracyProtesters,Support Democracy Protesters,"Street protests are taking place in a foreign country with historical ties to us. We do a lot of profitable trade with this country, but their government is authoritarian and we face pressure to openly support the cause of the street protesters."
#,SupportDemocracyProtesters_0,Support the protesters,"Do we believe in democracy or not? This should not be complicated. If the government is showing authoritarian tendencies, and we believe the protesters have a point, then we should stand by our principles and back them, not keep quiet because it earns us money in trade deals to look the other way."
#,SupportDemocracyProtesters_1,Make no comment,We would be angered if we faced protesters in our streets (as all democracies do) and foreign leaders started openly backing the protesters against our government. It would be terrible for our diplomatic relations with this trading partner if we took the side of the relatively small number of protesters in the streets.
#,SurgicalStrikes!,Surgical Strikes!,"Terrorists in the middle east have started to attack vital pipelines owned by our companies, and which indirectly provide us with fuel. In order to protect our oil supply, the army would like to start surgical strikes on carefully selected targets."
#,SurgicalStrikes!_0,Order surgical strikes,Terrorism is a real threat and rising oil prices limit growth. We have the means to disrupt terrorist operations without risking the lives of our soldiers. We have to strike now and prevent those terrorists from getting the upper hand.
#,SurgicalStrikes!_1,Do not engage,"The troubles in that area have economical and social reasons, that can not be solved by bombing terrorist leaders. A ground war and subsequent rebuilding are a more costly but far more effective way to solve the problems of this region."
#,TestBanTreaty,Nuclear Test Ban Treaty,The united nations is pushing for your country to sign a treaty that would ban us from carrying out any nuclear weapons tests for research purposes. Many other nations have already signed the treaty and are pressuring us to sign through diplomatic channels.
#,TestBanTreaty_0,Sign the treaty,"We have no real need to carry out further tests, it's not like the current generation of weapons do not work, or are not powerful enough. Signing the treaty will keep environmental campaigners happy and will raise our popularity on the international stage."
#,TestBanTreaty_1,Do not sign treaty,"It's vital that we retain the right to carry out limited testing. We live in a dangerous world and our nuclear deterrent is vital to our defense. It's not for other nations to tell us how to defend ourselves. Besides, testing is required to ensure our weapons still remain usable."
#,TortureDeportation,Torture Deportation,"Police officers have arrested a con-man who is a staying in our country illegally. Under normal circumstances, he would be eligible to be deported back to his country of origin. The man claims that if sent back to his homeland, it is likely he will be tortured by the government."
#,TortureDeportation_0,Deport him,"This man has nobody to blame for his situation but himself. He arrived here illegally, and has operated as a criminal since he got here. If he had claimed political asylum when he arrived and not began a life of crime it would be a different matter. In the circumstances we must take his claims of torture threats with a pinch of salt."
#,TortureDeportation_1,Keep him here,"It's clear that this man is hardly a model citizen, but no confidence trickster deserves to be tortured. If we truly oppose the use of torture on principle, then despite the mans history, we need to ensure we are not willing participants to torture by sending him back home. If we deport him, it could effectively become a death sentence."
#,ToxicWasteDump,Toxic Waste Dump,"A proposal has been put forward to construct a major toxic waste dump in our country. This facility will be very large, potentially creating many jobs in its construction, but there are concerns about its effect on the environment."
#,ToxicWasteDump_0,Allow the dump,"Nobody exactly WANTS toxic waste in their back garden, but we would be fools to turn our backs on the economic gains from setting up this facility, not to mention the potential jobs. Besides, we can place the dump in the countryside where the jobs are needed and the risks are low."
#,ToxicWasteDump_1,Prevent construction,"It doesn't matter how many jobs and how much money is involved, we cannot just take the attitude of renting out our country as a rubbish pit for other nations. The effects of this toxic waste could last for generations, is this really the legacy we want to leave for our children?"
#,TradeAgreement,Trade Agreement,"A group of western countries has established an initiative to set up a new trade agreement regulating tariffs, quotas and other trade restrictions. This contract should help to prevent emerging countries from catching up and secure worldwide economic dominance at the expense of global equality."
#,TradeAgreement_0,Sign agreement,Our economy is under stress from new players on the global market. We have to tie closer bonds with old friends in order to emerge victorious in this new hostile economic environment.
#,TradeAgreement_1,Refuse to sign agreement,This agreement would support our economy at the expense of global fairness. It is not the time to just think about ourselves but to welcome the new players on the global theater with open arms.
#,TransgenderMilitaryBan,Transgender Military Ban,We now have our first openly transgender serving military personnell. Sadly these soldiers have become the center of a bitter culture war between campaigning groups asking you to endorse or ban trans people from serving in the armed forces.
#,TransgenderMilitaryBan_0,Ban transgender soldiers,"If there are any concerns at any level that this will affect the performance or safety of our troops, then that comes first. This is not an arena for scoring cheap political points. Patriotic transgender citizens are welcome to serve in the military, but not in the front line combat roles."
#,TransgenderMilitaryBan_1,Endorse transgender soldiers,"What really matters in a soldier is their professionalism, their loyalty and patriotism. The idea that transgender soldiers are a bad idea is ridiculous. We should openly endorse and support all of our troops, regardless of gender."
#,TRAVELLERS RIGHTS,Travelers Rights,"A local council recently demolished some old abandoned housing, leaving empty land for travelers to park their caravans on, the local people are angry and wish to have them moved, the council are unsure what rights these people have and have turned to the government to clarify national policy."
#,TRAVELLERS RIGHTS_0,Allow travelers to stay,"Everybody has the right to live somewhere, including these travelers. There is no evidence that they are causing problems, this is just a case of people not understanding the lifestyles of traveling people."
#,TRAVELLERS RIGHTS_1,Evict the travelers,You must support the local people. These travelers have intruded on private property and upset local families. This is unacceptable. You cannot allow a small group of people to cause such disruption to otherwise peaceful communities.
#,ViolentVideoGames,Violent Video Games,"Concerns have been raised in the press about the impact that violent video games have on the nations youth. Some of these games are being described as 'murder simulators', and links have been suggested between the games and violent crime. there is a proposal to ban certain games and restrict the sale of others to those over 18 years old."
#,ViolentVideoGames_0,Leave unchanged,"There is scant hard evidence that shows any real direct link between video games and violence. In fact, there is a possibility they act as a catharsis that even prevents young people being violent. This is a knee jerk response from people looking for a simple solution to violence in society, violence that existed long before the first video game was created."
#,ViolentVideoGames_1,Censor games,"There may be no direct proven link, but you don't have to play many of these games to see how the influence they have on impressionable young people must be having a negative impact on society. Video games are an interactive medium and are likely to have a far more direct effect on impressionable minds that passive entertainment such as books, television or movies. Something needs to be done."
#,ViolentVideoGames_2,Add warning labels,"Banning is a step too far, but its important parents have the information they need so that they can judge how suited a specific game is for their children. A system, of warnings about content on the box or websites selling games should be sufficient."
#,Whaling,Whaling,A resolution is before the government proposing the re-introduction of small scale commercial whaling in our waters. Whale meat is a prized local delicacy and commercial whaling would create many jobs.
#,Whaling_0,Resume whaling,"Whales consume an enormous amount of fish, and may be responsible for a drop in fish catches that affect our economy. Whaling would also provide a welcome boost to our economy. Not every species of whale is endangered, and commercial whaling can go ahead without danger of causing extinction."
#,Whaling_1,Keep ban in place,"Whales are generally accepted to be amongst the most intelligent non-human species on earth, they maintain a crucial position in the aquatic food-chain and yet have been hunted close to extinction. Restarting commercial whaling would be incredibly destructive, as well as potentially causing a drop in tourism. We should refocus our efforts on whale watching rather than hunting."
#,Whistleblower,Whistleblower,A secret service contractor has leaked several documents that shed a light on the dark side of the war on terror. Should we prosecute her and do everything we can to bring her to justice or should we reform the secret service and stop making use of the malpractices she accuses us of?
#,Whistleblower_0,Prosecute!,"Even if the accusations we are facing are true, we have to protect national interests. The public might not understand why we have to rely to these methods in the war on terror but the end justifies the means."
#,Whistleblower_1,Reform secret service!,The practices made public by Stacey Walker are indeed unworthy of a developed nation. We have to abstain from such methods in the future and thank Stacey Walker for demonstrating that civil courage still exists.
#,WhitewashSchoolHistoryBooks,Rewrite School History Books,"Many of the textbooks used in school history lessons are outdated and reflect a somewhat generous view of our countries past and its achievements. Campaigners are suggesting major changes to the way children are taught our history, to evaluate our past with a modern attitude."
#,WhitewashSchoolHistoryBooks_0,Rewrite the textbooks,"It is quite shocking just how biased the dated textbooks are in our schools. Judging by these books, our history is suspiciously male, racially pure and without fault, whereas we know the real picture is extremely different. We cannot continue whitewashing our history and teaching children things we know to be untrue."
#,WhitewashSchoolHistoryBooks_1,Leave textbooks alone,"This is simply middle-class liberal guilt attempting to rewrite history. You cannot judge the great statespeople and military leaders of our past through the lens of modern thinking. Society was different back then, and their behavior was perfectly acceptable at the time. What sort of government re-writes our proud history?"
#,USAOilPipeline,Approve New Oil Pipeline,"A proposed pipeline that connects extensive oil sands in Canada to refineries in Illinois and Texas requires federal government approval. The pipeline is controversial because it would increase oil extraction, and hasten climate change, and also because it would cross the territories of a number of native American tribes."
#,USAOilPipeline_0,Approve the pipeline,"No large infrastructure project would ever be approved if the government gave into every protest. Like it or not, our economy needs fossil fuels, and there is evidence this development would reduce oil prices as well as creating economic growth. What's more important? The economy? or the opinions of a relatively small group of hardcore environmental protesters?"
#,USAOilPipeline_1,Cancel the pipeline,"Is there really any justification for enabling more fossil fuel consumption right now? We should be investing in renewable energy, not extracting more oil. Plus what right do we have to trash the sacred grounds of indigenous tribes simply to make transporting Canadian oil more efficient?"
#,GermanyDieselgate,Diesel Emissions Scandal,"A scandal has been exposed revealing that many of the largest and most prestigious car companies in our country have been blatantly lying about the emissions from their diesel vehicles, in a deliberate and very profitable scheme to cheat the official tests. How should the police handle this incredibly high profile case?"
#,GermanyDieselgate_0,Play down the importance of the case,"This case is being blown out of all proportion. Fines can be issued, and the cars can be re-tested and given revised emissions numbers. A few over-enthusiastic engineers bent the rules a bit too much, but this is hardly anything new."
#,GermanyDieselgate_1,Imprison the chief executives if possible,"There can be no doubt here that the people at the very top of these companies knew exactly what was going on, and we have to be 100% clear that here in Germany, the law applies equally to everyone. It will not be popular with business owners, but to preserve our international reputation we have to make an example of these cheats."
#,AustraliaAboriginalMining,Mining On Aboriginal Land,"There is a proposal to develop a large mine in the Northern Territory. The mine would generate a lot of jobs and be a significant boost to the economy, but the ownership of the land is in dispute, with aboriginal rights campaigners demanding the development be stopped."
#,AustraliaAboriginalMining_0,Approve the mine,"You cannot halt all economic activity because of some ancient claim to land ownership. We need jobs, and we need to send a signal that this country supports business."
#,AustraliaAboriginalMining_1,Ban the mine,"Its totally unsupportable to allow development of this land. The aboriginal claims to ownership of the land must be respected, however inconvenient this may be for the economy."
#,AustraliaAboriginalMining_2,Split ownership of mine,"There is no need to take an extreme position here. No, we should not stand in the way of economic development, but the claim to land ownership is real, and the aboriginal people should be fairly compensated. The mine can go ahead, if 10% of the profit from the mine is given in perpetuity to the native title holders."
