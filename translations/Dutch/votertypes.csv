#,Socialist,socialistische,socialisten,"Socialists believe in a redistribution of wealth from the rich to the poor to counteract the inequality that can arise in the free market. A large state, paid for by taxation, provides essential services such as healthcare, education , housing and public transportation to everybody. Fundamentally, socialists believe in the maxim 'to each according to their needs, from each according to their means'."
#,Capitalist,kapitalisten,kapitalisten,"Capitalists are believers in the 'invisible hand' of the free market, as the most efficient and fair way to distribute resources. The basic principle is that people are entitled to profit from their own labour, and that the state should keep out of the way of private enterprise. State intervention, such as state-healthcare is seen as a market distortion that effectively takes the proceeds of the hard-working, and hands it to the less-deserving."
#,Retired,Gepensioneerde, gepensioneerde mensen,"Retired people, and the elderly who may still be working are a powerful political force. Turnout at elections tends to be higher, and they have time to be active in political campaigning. Naturally they are more concerned about healthcare outcomes than the average citizen, and are also sensitive to changes in pension provision, as in many cases this is their only source of income."
#,Commuter, Forenzen, pendelaars,"Commuters includes anybody traveling some distance to work, whether this is by car, train, bus, monorail or tram. For commuters, transport costs and traffic congestion are hot political issues. Commuters who spend a lot of their time sat in traffic, or are unable to get to work due to strikes will have plenty of time to make their feelings known to politicians."
#,Patriot,Patriot,patriotten,"Patriotism is often used cynically as a political football at election time, but for some voters their patriotism is a core part of their national identity. Patriots are strong supporters of a distinct national identity, a strong military defense for the country, and strong borders."
#,Motorist,Automobilist,automobilisten,"The extent to which a voter considers themselves a motorist may vary, from die-hard car enthusiasts to the occasional user of a small 'city-car'. However everyone who drives is affected in some way by vehicle taxes, road pricing, fuel taxes, congestion and any incentives or subsidies regarding fuel types. As a result, motorists can be an important group at election time."
#,Liberal,liberaal,liberaal,"A complex group to define. In some countries liberalism is confused with socialism, but true liberalism is a belief in personal liberty and freedom, that overlaps a number of other voter groups. Liberals are strongly against state surveilance, and in favor of the principle that individual choice is to be respected, on issues ranging from sexuality to gun ownership to recreational drug usage."
#,Religious,Religieuze,religieuze mensen,"Religious opinions and strength of feeling obviously varies greatly, but in general religious voters hold a positive opinion of faith schools and religious education, and will support laws that keep holy days sacred, or protect the church from blasphemy. As a rule, religious voters have a negative view of abortion, and stem cell research. Generally, religious views are more popular in less-developed countries."
#,TradeUnionist, Vakbondsleden, vakbondsleden,"Trade union members are strongly concerned about the rights of workers in large organisations, and fight for higher pay, shorter hours, and more rights at work. Trade union membership can lead to more support for industrial action (strikes). Low wages, high unemployment and a lack of welfare can be factors in encouraging workers to join unions."
#,SelfEmployed,Zelfstandigen,zelfstandigen,"The self employed also includes people who run small businesses, such as plumbers and electricians. Entrepreneurs and small business owners are opposed to too much state regulation and workers rights as they come with bureaucratic costs. They also feel the effects of taxes on sales or capital gains that come from owning your own business."
#,Environmentalist,milieuactivisten,milieuactivisten,"Environmentalists can align with any part of the political spectrum, but they share a concern about pollution, climate change and animal rights. There is a vast range of policies that can address these issues, but environmentalists are concerned more with the outcome than the methods. Pollution and severe weather events will push more citizens into joining the environmentalist group."
#,Wealthy,Rijke, rijke mensen,"Whether their wealth comes from personal effort or inheritance, this group represents the voters who have the most to lose to wealth and income taxes, or taxes on luxury spending. The wealthy are more mobile than any other social group, so difficult to tax effectively. Also note that those on middle incomes aspire to achieve wealth, and generally aspire to not be taxed when it happens."
#,Poor,Arme, arme mensen,"Those in society that are economically disadvantaged are naturally more reliant on welfare payments from the state, and take a keen interest in inequality and any measures that transfer money from the wealthy one per cent to the rest. Depending on wage levels, this group may include a large or small amount of unemployed people."
#,MiddleIncome,Middeninkomens,middeninkomens,"Traditionally a large section of the population, but liable to shrink if inequality rises. The middle classes are generally politically moderate, employed, car-owners enjoying a holiday each year and aspire to own their own home outright. The middle classes have a stake in society that they will not want to lose to civil unrest or crime, often leading to centrist views."
#,Parents,Ouders,ouders,"The extent to which voters consider themselves primarily parents will depend on how many children they have, and how young they are. Those with large young families will be extremely sensitive to issues such as childcare provision or affordability, and the costs and quality of education provision. School safety and transport to school are also big issues."
#,Farmers,Boeren,boeren,"Not just actual farmers, but also people in associated industries and rural communities. Priorities for rural voters often differ from those in capital cities, and any taxes (or more commonly...subsidies) that apply to agriculture will be a huge issue. A tendency to overregulate food production will likely be unpopular with this group."
#,StateEmployees,Staatswerknemers, staatswerknemers,"Anybody working in a state owned industry or service falls in this group, to which they may or may not identify strongly. This includes state health and education workers, but also often the police, military and local government employees. Nobody is more attuned to cuts in public spending than those voters for whom such cuts directly affect their wages and job prospects."
#,Conservatives,Conservatieven,conservatieven,"The polar opposite of liberals, conservatives are big supporters of what is generally thought of as 'family' or 'traditional' values. This group is likely to oppose liberalisation of drug policy, and to be outraged by sexual scandals or misdeeds. Conservatives are not keen on identity politics, gay marriage, infidelity or legalised prostitution."
#,Young,Jongeren,jongeren,"Old enough to vote, but young enough to still be in education, or to have recent memories of it. Naturally the young are more focused on education than they are pension or retirement ages. In some cases they may still be paying off any debt incurred by fees during education. More politically active than the middle aged."
#,EthnicMinorities,etnische minderheden, etnische minderheden,"In some countries the minority is black, in others white, in others the original native inhabitants. Ethnic minorities are obviously highly concerned by racism in society, and will also be concerned by immigration policy that could be seen as discriminatory. They may also have strong views on foreign relations, given relatives overseas."
#,_All_,Iedereen, mensen,"Every voter is in this group, and it will only be affected by actions, policies and situations that affect everybody equally regardless of age, occupation or wealth."
