#,Welcome,Welcome!,"Welcome to Democracy 4! You have just started your first term as <PRESIDENT>, and as your Chief of Staff, I'm here to explain how things work. The icons below show you a few key indicators of the state of our country. Hopefully you can change things for the better, and get re-elected after your term is up! Press the button in the window below (marked ""Begin term of office"") to start governing..."
#,MainScreen,Main Screen,"From here you can survey the current state of our country. It may look complex, but all the different components work in very similar ways. The icons represent different objects in the economy or society, including policies, laws, voter groups and values for important concepts such as health and education levels of our citizens. Click the next button."
#,VoterStrips,Voters,"These strips on the left of the screen represent groups of voters, with the colored progress bars indicating how happy they are with your government. The lighter area behind the text shows the percentage of our electorate that is in each of these groups. One of the key concepts of Democracy 4 is to understand that individual voters can be members of many different voter groups at once, and the extent to which they identify with those groups is in itself variable. You will never get *all* of these voter groups to entirely approve of you, as some are opposites!"
#,PolicyIcons,Policies,"White icons are policies. You start the game with some already implemented, but most can be cancelled and many more can be added. They can also be adjusted. Policies are the primary method you use to govern the country."
#,SimIcons,Data,"Blue icons represent statistical data relevant to your country. They concern abstract concepts such as GDP (gross domestic product - Strength of the economy), crime or the education level of your citizens. You can affect statistical data only indirectly, through policy decisions. Like the other icons, you will find them in different 'zones' of the screen depending on which part of the economy/society they represent (transport, tax etc...)."
#,SitIcons,Situations,Icons with a red or green background are situations. These are ongoing events taking place in your country which may be going well (green) or badly (red). You can encourage good situations and prevent or fix bad ones by your policy choices.
#,Connections,Connections,"Policies, data and situations are inter-connected through 'effects'. Hovering your mouse over any one of the icons will show how influence flows between them, with green being a positive effect, and red being negative. The speed of flow also shows the strength of the effect. Experiment with this, then hit 'next'."
#,VoterType,Voters!,Let's take a look at a specific group of voters and find out more about them. Click on the voter strip for 'Middle Income' voters.
#,VoterType2,Voter Types,"This window shows detailed information on a specific group of voters. Each group of voters have their own opinions and priorities, and every event or policy will affect each group in different ways. The chart currently shows the opinion of these voters over time, or you can select their income or group membership over time."
#,VoterType3,Inputs,"This area shows a list of different 'inputs' to this voter group, and how they make the group feel. Green effects are good and positive, red effects are bad and negative. Those effects may change over time as policies, situations or values change. The sum of all these effects go towards determining how the group feels."
#,VoterType4,Drilling-down,"You can click on an individual effect as a short-cut to seeing more information about that item. For example, click on the effect showing the influence Income tax has on our middle class voters."
#,IncomeTax1,Income Tax,"And here we are at the details screen for Income Tax! You can do this for almost any effect between two items. Income tax is a policy (white icons), and this screen shows you the effects that policy is having."
#,PolicySlider,Policy Slider,"The slider is used to control this specific policy. You can use it to adjust income tax up or down, which will change the effects it has on all the linked items, such as voter groups, situations and statistical data. Experiment with the slider and then hit 'next'."
#,PolicySlider2,Policy Slider,"You probably noticed that the effects show two different values as you move the slider, the current (darker) effect, and the effect with the slider at its new position. The values will move from where they are, to the new position over time, based on  the inertia time (in number of turns) at the far right of each effect. If that value is zero, the effect will be at the new level by the start of the next turn."
#,RevertChanges,Revert Changes,"Let's leave things as they are for now. Hit the 'revert changes' button to indicate that we want to leave this policy untouched, despite having adjusted the slider."
#,QuitPolicy,Quit Policy Screen,"Right, that's enough looking at income tax, hit the close button at the top right and let's return to the main screen."
#,Situations,Situations,Time to check out one of the situations that currently affect our country. Click on any of the situation icons you want more information on.
#,Situations2,Situations,"This shows information on the selected situation. As you can see, situations have both causes (on the left) and effects. You cannot change anything here, all you can do is see the various effects. Situations can be ended if you reduce the strength of the causes sufficiently."
#,Situations3,Triggers and Graphs,"The chart at the top of this screen shows information on the actual strength of this situation over time, and two triggers. The higher trigger is the value that actually triggers this situation to take effect. The lower trigger deactivates the situation. As a result, it's easier to trigger a situation than to end it."
#,Situations4,Situations,Let's quit this situation and go look at some other data now. Hit the close button.
#,Simvalue,Statistics,"Let's take a look at the last type of icon, the statistical data. Click on any of the blue icons."
#,Simvalue2,Statistics,"This screen shows information on a national statistic. Like a situation, it has causes and effects  Be aware that some statistical values are good things that we want high (like health) others are bad things that we want low (such as crime)."
#,Simvalue3,Statistics,"There is nothing we can change here, so let's hit the close button and go back to the main screen again."
#,PoliticalCapital,Political Capital,"Pay attention to this value in the center icon. This is 'political capital', which represents the amount of support your government has to get things done. You have a limited amount of political capital per turn (each turn is a quarter of a year), When you run out, you need to end the turn to get more. Some political capital can be carried over to the next turn, but not all. Click the icon for details."
#,PoliticalCapital2,Political Capital,"Political capital is used when you adjust policies, cancel them or introduce new ones. Different policies require different amounts, depending on how controversial they are. Capital is generated by ministers, your popularity and by how dramatically you won the previous election."
#,PoliticalCapital3,Political Capital,Lets go back to the main screen. Close the political capital window for now.
#,NewPolicy1,New Policies,"Okay, it's time to see how to create a new policy. Click the new policy button."
#,NewPolicy2,New Policies,These are new policies that advisors have prepared for you to select from. The policies are divided into categories seen as tabs at the left. Details of a selected policy are on the right. Those in red cannot currently be implemented due to a lack of political capital. Select a policy and then hit the implement button.
#,NewPolicy3,New Policies,"This is the new policy you chose to implement. You can adjust the slider on new policies for free (without using up political capital) . Be aware that some policies take time to implement which means it will be a while before they are fully operational. For now, let's go back to the main screen. Hit the close button at the top right."
#,NextTurn,Next Turn,"There is much more to see, but we shall come to that later. Once you have finished what you can do, or want to do in a quarter, it's time to end the turn. Hit the end turn button at the top right of the screen."
,,,
#,Report,Report,"This is the quarterly report. It will highlight some key indicators which impact upon the current state of the country. Plus there may be other information you need to be aware of. Urgent dilemmas may appear that need your attention this quarter. Anyway...I can see you have a lot to attend to, so I'll let you get to work. I'm sure the government is in safe hands now."
,,,
#,Expenses,Expenditure,"This chart shows a breakdown of government expenditure. You can click on an individual items for more detail. Note that the cost of many items will vary over time, depending on a variety of factors."
,,,
#,Income,Income,"This chart shows a breakdown of government income or revenue. If revenue is less than expenditure, the shortfall or deficit will be made up from government borrowing. This might be okay in the short term but borrowing  increases the national debt. All debt will incur interest payments. You can click on any item to see further details."
,,,
#,Charts,Charts,"The charts screen shows a number of vital indicators for your economy over time. The global economy will influence your own GDP. Your debt level should always be a concern, as when it gets too high, the bond market may get nervous and charge a higher interest rate which could lead to a debt spiral."
,,,
#,Intel,Intel,"This is your intelligence briefing room. We monitor a number of organizations. Some of them are relatively harmless, but they can act as 'gateways' into more extremist, dangerous groups, so we still need to keep an eye on their membership. Our chances of preventing attacks on government will vary based on what security policies you have in place."
,,,
#,Polling,Polling,"This is the polling data. It shows lines for each voter group indicating how their opinion of government has changed over time. You can toggle each line on and off using the color buttons, and visit each voter group by clicking their names, but let's come back to that later..."
#,Polling2,Polling,Let's check out the focus groups while we are here. Hit the focus group button.
#,FocusGroup,Focus Group,"The individuals (lined up at the bottom) are members of a random focus group. Click on an individual voter at the bottom to see information about them, or you can create a new focus group with the circular blue icon."
#,FocusGroup2,Focus Group,"For each individual, this diagram shows the extent to which they associate with each voter group they are in, the opinion they get from that association, and how that all comes together to show the final opinion they have of your government."
#,FocusGroup3,Focus Group,Let's now take a look at the popularity of your policies in the polls. Hit the policies button.
,,,
,,,
#,Cabinet,Cabinet,"This shows who you have working in each government department. Each minister will have a different level of experience, and loyalty, both of which may change over time. Experienced ministers are more effective at their jobs. They can get policies implemented faster and cheaper. Be aware that over time, the loyalty of your ministers may vary."
#,Cabinet2,Cabinet,"Disloyal ministers will provide less political capital, so you may eventually need to consider firing some, or maybe reshuffling the cabinet entirely. Also, be aware that each minister is popular with different voter groups, so having them in the cabinet may keep certain voters happy, to an extent... "
#,Cabinet3,Cabinet,I'll leave you to decide the career prospects of your colleagues now. Don't forget you can always view potential replacement ministers before you fire anyone...
,,,
#,Polls,Polls,"This chart shows an estimate of the percentage of the electorate that claim they would vote for you if there were an election right now. This may not be accurate as turnout is unlikely to be 100%. Voters with no strong view either way may not show up to vote on election day, unless it's made compulsory."
,,,
,,,
#,Electioneering,Electioneering,"This is the 'electioneering' screen where you can choose between different tabs to view different aspects of your party and candidates chances for re-election! Some options, such as speeches and manifestos may not be applicable until just before the election, so its probably best to concentrate on running the country until then."
#,Manifestos,Manifestos,"Manifesto promises are optional, but if you need a last-minute pre-election boost, making grandiose claims to the electorate might be a good idea. Be warned that if you DO get re-elected, you will be punished by the voters if you break these promises."
#,Speeches,Speeches,"Speeches can be made in the turns leading up to the election. The positive news is that such speeches can gather support from voter groups without you actually having to make any real proposals or promises. The bad news is that each sound-bite you pick will probably upset some voters as well as making some happy, so choose your sound-bites wisely."
#,Speech Results,Speech Results,"This screen shows you the results of your speech, illustrating how popular it is with a wide focus group of all voters as you go from sound-bite to sound-bite. Higher values are obviously better, but few speeches will be able to please everyone."
#,Fundraising,Fundraising,"Raising funds for your election campaign is done partly through activists, and partly through wealthy donors. Activists join and leave over time based on your actions. Big Donors work the same way, but you are able to gauge their mood here and maybe head-off losing a big donors before they get too mad."
#,Perceptions,Perceptions,"Voter perceptions of your candidate and party can have an important influence with 'undecided' voters. In an ideal world your party will be seen as high in all 3 major perception measurements. In practice your policies probably prevent that, but you can compensate with media events. Dont waste media events too far from an election, as their effects will wear off over time."
,,,
#,Happiness ,Happiness ,"This chart shows everybody in this voter group, and where they are on the spectrum from happiness (green) to anger (red). Voters are in many different groups, so its not just this group that influences their opinion. Clicking on an individual dot will show this voter inside the focus group screen."
