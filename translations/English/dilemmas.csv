#,RussianDeal_0,It's Not Right,"Your top advisor says, 'Who makes a deal like this? They asked for nothing. They must be trying to do something. We cannot be tricked by them, even if they will supply and help us.'",
#,RussianDeal_1,We Should Trust Them,"Your vice president says, 'Yes, it seems a bit off, but it's a great deal. Either way, we are sick of fighting. No matter what they will do, it's better then fighting those terrorists.'",

#,SaudiDeal_0,It's A Great Deal!!,"We must accept! This deal will stop a rivalry that costs both sides a lot of money. This can improve our economy a lot, and they are risking their alliance with the USA to make this deal. Lets sign it!",
#,SaudiDeal_1,NO, WE CANNOT!,"We can't accept this deal. We will be selling our oil at a way cheaper price. Yes, we don't sell much oil, but we cannot just hand it to them. It's smarter to make a counter deal or to simply refuse!",

#,NewDams_0,It's A Bad Idea,"We need the power, but the plan provided means we cut water sources to other nations that need the water. The world will hate us!",
#,NewDams_1,We Must Build Them!,"Most of those nations don't like us anyways. We are fighting them in the China Sea for control, so let's show them the power of China!",

#,Artifacts,Indigenous People Claim Relics!,"For a century, one of our museums has had a display of sacred relics from an indigenous tribe in a former colony. Representatives of the tribe say that the relics were stolen, and have requested that they be returned to their homeland. The tribe has offered us newly crafted replicas as a replacement."
#,Artifacts_0,Give Back Relics,"We have stolen land and freedom from indigenous people. The least we can do is give back these relics. We will take their word that they will put them on display in their homeland."
#,Artifacts_1,Keep Relics On Display,"We have kept the relics safe for a hundred years and displayed them to the public. If we give them away, they might be damaged or stolen. These relics belong in a museum!"
#,Autonomy,Autonomy For Indigenous Nation?,"Since time immemorial, an indigenous tribe has lived in a province that was annexed by our country a few centuries ago. Today, some of these people are requesting a local legislature. Autonomy would promote their native language and culture, as well as reduce racial tension. More patriotic members of the tribe are concerned that an autonomous province would become poorer than our country as a whole."
#,Autonomy_0,Grant Autonomy,"Long ago, we stole the land from this tribe, and it's about time we gave it back. It might be a setback for welfare, but you cannot put a price on freedom. All peoples should be able to elect politicians who speak their own language."
#,Autonomy_1,Integrate indigenous people,"Our nation rests on unity in diversity. Our government has functioned well, and we shall not send these people into a poverty trap. Their culture has survived until today, and it will survive in the future, as part of our national heritage."
#,CartoonCrisis,Prophet Cartoon Crisis!,"A national newspaper has posted a series of cartoons which mock a foreign religious prophet. Religious leaders complain that the cartoons are racist, and suggest an international boycott against our country. In an unusual alliance, liberals and patriots argue that all religious authorities should be subject to criticism."
#,CartoonCrisis_0,Condemn Cartoons,"We are a privileged people who need to be sensitive about anything racism. Of course we cannot legally censor the newspaper, but punishing the media company by boycotting them, and siding with the religious congregation, would calm down the complaints."
#,CartoonCrisis_1,Defend Cartoons,"Free speech is a cornerstone of a civilized society, especially when it comes to questioning of religious dogma. Domestic and foreign figures of authority should not be able to evade criticism and satire."
#,CitizenByBirth,Citizenship By Birth Or Blood?,"With increasing immigration, we need to review our citizenship law. Who should be born a citizen of our country?"
#,CitizenByBirth_0,Citizenship By Birthright,"Immigrant families argue that all children born here should become citizens, regardless of their parents' citizenship."
#,CitizenByBirth_1,Citizenship By Blood,"Conservatives argue that lineage is more important than birthplace. Only children born to a parent who is citizen of our country should be citizens here. In practice, this means that we will have less immigration, and more emigration."
#,HolyLand,Palestinian Conflict,"The never-ending conflict between Israel and Palestine has escalated again. Israel makes clear that they will terminate diplomatic relations with any nation that recognizes their rival. What side shall we choose?"
#,HolyLand_0,Do Not Recognize Palestine,"Capitalists point out that Israel is the only democratic nation in the Middle East, and an important provider of high technology. Palestine lacks control of most of its claimed territory and is not a functional country."
#,HolyLand_1,Recognize Palestine,"Socialists emphasize that Israel is is an oppressive occupation government, responsible of most of the deaths in the conflict. The international community prefers a two-state solution, so we will likely need to recognize Palestine sooner or later. If we do, we would also improve relations with oil-exporting Arab countries."
#,RaceCensus,Census Based On Race,"As a new census is coming up, there is debate about whether the government should record citizens' self-identified ethnic background, religious creed, or race. Socialists claim that these records would be useful to highlight and counter discrimination. Liberals and religious people warn about the risk that the system could be abused."
#,RaceCensus_0,Record Ethnicity,"Although modern science has disproved the concept of race, we cannot ignore the existence of discrimination against people with certain characteristics. This reform will allow the government and private sector to treat citizens equally and provide data useful to social scientists."
#,RaceCensus_1,Do Not Record Ethnicity,"History has taught us the dangers of records based on ethnic background. There is a risk that the government or another body will use these surveys to discriminate. Some of these groups could even be rounded up and detained. There is only one race--the human one."
#,LegalizeBribery,Legalize Bribery,"Bribery has become commonplace amongst our country's politicians. The situation is so bad that even the most routine pieces of legislation are being held up by political favors. This must be addressed."
#,LegalizeBribery_0,Increase Oversight,"Horsetrading, whether referred to as lobbying or bribery, is destroying our country. We need to cut off this culture of corruption at the source."
#,LegalizeBribery_1,Legalize Bribery,"Why beat around the bush? Politicians do favors for each other all the time. That's the only way anything gets done. All of this secrecy is why things are moving so slowly in the first place!"
#,ContributionLimits,Contribution Limits,"Large, anonymous contributions have become commonplace in our society. There are many who question the fairness of this practice and insist that it subverts democracy and the principle of 'one person, one vote.' Others insist that this falls under free speech."
#,ContributionLimits_0,Increase Contribution Limits,"Politics is for the big sharks. Sharks are winners. And they don't look back. 'Cause they don't have necks. Necks are for sheep. We need a proud shepherd for this herd of sharks."
#,ContributionLimits_1,Lower Contribution Limits,"Anonymous political contributions from the super-rich are overly distorting the political debate in our country. Furthermore, multinational corporations can exploit this and potentially allow foreign interests to influence our policy. This should be considered an outrage in any country that calls itself a democracy."
