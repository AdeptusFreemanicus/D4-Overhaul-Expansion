#,Artifacts_0,Give back relics,"We have stolen land and freedom from indigenous people. The least thing we can do today, is giving back these relics. We will take their word that they will put them on display in their homeland."
#,Artifacts_1,Keep relics on display,"We have kept the relics safe for a hundred years, and displayed them to the public. If we give them away, they might be damaged or stolen. These relics belong in a museum!"
#,Autonomy,Autonomy for indigenous nation?,"Since time immemorial, an indigenous tribe has lived in a province, which was annexed by our country a few centuries ago. Today, some of these people request a local legislature. Autonomy would promote their native language and culture, as well as reducing racial tension. More patriotic members of the tribe are concerned that an autonomous province would become poorer than our country as a whole."
#,Autonomy_0,Grant autonomy,"Long ago, we stole the land from this tribe, and is about time we give it back. It might be a setback for welfare, but you cannot put a price on freedom. All peoples should be able to elect politicians who speak their own language."
#,Autonomy_1,Integrate indigenous people,"Our nation rests on unity in diversity. Our government has functioned well, and we shall not send these people into a poverty trap. Their culture has survived until today, and it will survive in the future, as part of our national heritage."
#,CartoonCrisis,Prophet Cartoon Crisis!,"A national newspaper has posted a series of cartoons which mock a foreign religious prophet. Religious leaders complain that the cartoons are racist, and suggest an international boycott against our country. In an unusual alliance, liberals and patriots argue that all religious authorities should be subject to criticism."
#,CartoonCrisis_0,Condemn cartoons,"We are a privileged people, who need to be sensitive about anything similar to racism. Of course we cannot legally censor the newspaper, but punishing the media company by boycotting them, and siding with the religious congregation, would calm down the complaints."
#,CartoonCrisis_1,Defend cartoons,"Free speech is a cornerstone of a civilized society, especially when it comes to questioning of religious dogma. Domestic and foreign figures of authority, should not be able to evade criticism and satire."
#,CitizenByBirth,Citizenship by birth?,"With increasing immigration, we need to review our citizenship law. Who should be born a citizen of our country?"
#,CitizenByBirth_0,Citizenship by birthplace,"Immigrant families argue that all children born here should become citizens, regardless of parents' citizenship."
#,CitizenByBirth_1,Citizenship by lineage,"Conservatives argue that lineage is more important than birthplace. Children born to a mother, or a proved father, who is citizen of our country, should be citizens here. In practice, this means that we will have less immigration, and more emigration."
#,HolyLand,Palestinian conflict,"The neverending conflict between Israel and Palestine has escalated again. Israel makes clear that they will terminate diplomatic relations with any nation that recognizes their rival. What side shall we choose?"
#,HolyLand_0,Do not recognize Palestine,"Capitalists point out that Israel is the only democratic nation in the Middle East, and an important provider of high technology. Palestine lacks control of most of its claimed territory, and is not a functional country."
#,HolyLand_1,Recognize Palestine,"Socialists emphasize that Israel is is an oppressive occupation government, responsible of most deaths in the conflict. The international community prefers a two-state solution, so we need to recognize Palestine sooner or later. If we do, we would also improve relations with oil-exporting Arab countries."
#,RaceCensus,Census based on race,"As a new census is coming up, there is debate whether the government should record citizens' self-identified ethnic background, religious creed, or "race". Socialists claim that these records would be useful to highlight and counter discrimination. Liberals and religious people warn about the risk that the system could be abused."
#,RaceCensus_0,Record ethnicity,"Although modern science has disproved the concept of "race", we cannot ignore the existence of discrimination against people of certain appearance. This reform will make government and private sector more aware to treat citizens equally, and provide data useful to social scientists."
#,RaceCensus_1,Do not record ethnicity,"History has taught us the dangers of records based on ethnic background. There is risk that the government, or another body, surveys people based on their ethnicity or creed; or even worse, that some of these groups would be rounded up and detained. There is only one race; the human one."
#,LegalizeBribery,Legalize Bribery,"Bribery has become commonplace amongst our country's politicians. The situation is so bad that even the most routine pieces of legislation are being held up by political favors. This must be addressed."
#,LegalizeBribery_0,Increase Oversight,"Horsetrading, whether referred to as lobbying or bribery, is destroying our country. We need to cut off this culture of corruption at the source."
#,LegalizeBribery_1,Legalize Bribery,"Why beat around the bush? Politicians do favors for each other all the time, that's the only way anything gets done. All of this secrecy is why things are moving so slowly in the first place!"
#,ContributionLimits,Contribution Limits,"Large, anonymous contributions have become commonplace in our society. There are many who question the fairness of this practice and insist that it subverts democracy and the principle of 'one person, one vote'. Others insist that this falls under free speech."
#,ContributionLimits_0,Increase Contribution Limits,"Politics is for the big sharks. Sharks are winners. And they don't look back. 'Cause they don't have necks. Necks are for sheep. We need a proud shepherd for this herd of sharks."
#,ContributionLimits_1,Lower Contribution Limits,"Anonymous political contributions from the super-rich are overly distorting the political debate in our country. Furthermore, multinational corporations can exploit this and potentially allow foreign interests to influence our policy. This should be considered an outrage in any country that calls itself a democracy."
